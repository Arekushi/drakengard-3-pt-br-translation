I am...worried.{#Name="Decadus"}
About what?{#Name="Zero"}
About Mikhail.{#Name="Decadus"}
Don't be. He's fine.{#Name="Zero"}
But...{#Name="Decadus"}
I'm telling you. He's fine.{#Name="Zero"}
Very well.{#Name="Decadus"}
I'm sure Mikhail is safe. But we should rescue him nonetheless.{#Name="Decadus"}
That was quite the scene earlier, wasn't it!{#Name="Octa"}
First, your dragon makes a meal out of Lady Three,{LF}then he's stolen away by another disciple? Madness!{#Name="Octa"}
......{#Name="Zero"}
You ordered him to eat her, I presume?{#Name="Octa"}
Nope, sure didn't.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, my... Such a cruel twist of fate!{#Name="Octa"}
Lady Three suffered a cruel end. Perhaps you and I{LF}should "commemorate" her passing, mmmmm?{#Name="Octa"}
So you know that guy who stole your dumb dragon?{LF}That was Cent.{#Name="Dito"}
He's the disciple here in the Land of Sands.{#Name="Dito"}
Two's disciple, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
Yep. They seem young, beautiful, and madly in love.{LF}Makes me wanna hurl!{#Name="Dito"}
竜を２人の子ども代わりに育てていたりしてな{#Name="ゼロ"}
なんですか、その昔話みたいなほっこり感！{#Name="ディト"}
This Cent guy seems like a real charmer, doesn't he?{LF}Probably better to just kill him when you take out Two.{#Name="Dito"}
So what do you think those two are planning, anyway?{#Name="Dito"}
Planning? As if either of them were smart enough{LF}to have an actual plan.{#Name="Zero"}
Really? I figured Cent took your dragon because Two ordered it.{#Name="Dito"}
She's gotta have some reason for doing that, right? {#Name="Dito"}
......{#Name="Zero"}
325{#Name="325"}
Zero defeated Three, but lost Mikhail to the disciple, Cent, in the process.{#Name="Accord"}
The group headed for Cent's home in the Land of Sands{LF}to try and rescue the dragon...{#Name="Accord"}
