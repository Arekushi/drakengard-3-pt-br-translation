Well, Lady Zero? I was thinking maybe we could{LF}get it on tonight. The game is afoot, mmm?{#Name="Octa"}
Get it on? Hey, you guys shouldn't fight!{LF}We all need to get along!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Oh ho ho! Worry not, dear dragon.{LF}Zero and I couldn't get along any better when it comes to this!{#Name="Octa"}
Tonight? Meeeeeeh, no. I gotta...wash my hair. {#Name="Zero"}
Hey, Zero! Let me play the get-it-on game too!{#Name="Mikhail"}
That's...not a good idea.{#Name="Octa"}
Why not?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Well, you see, you're a... I mean...{#Name="Octa"}
Drop it, Octa.{#Name="Zero"}
Aw, come on! I wanna know!{#Name="Mikhail"}
If we're all friends and stuff, why can't I play{LF}the get-it-on game? Huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Come on, let me! I bet I'd be real good at it!{#Name="Mikhail"}
No! And Octa's not playing tonight either.{#Name="Zero"}
But...the burning passion in my loins!{#Name="Octa"}
Just remember, your dear Octa is ready for{LF}full deployment at a moment's notice!{#Name="Octa"}
Decadus and Octa sure do have a rough time of it.{#Name="Cent"}
What?{#Name="Zero"}
Well, they now serve you, Lady Zero, yeees?{#Name="Cent"}
Which means they're gonna have to kill their own{LF}Intoners at some point...{#Name="Cent"}
Uuunnngh...{#Name="Decadus"}
Oooh. Looks like I hit a nerve there.{#Name="Cent"}
What about your Intoner, Cent?{#Name="Octa"}
Lady Two? Mmmm...{#Name="Cent"}
I'm afraid that's my little secret!{#Name="Cent"}
God, I hate this guy. Can't we just kill him?{LF}Like, now? Please?{#Name="Dito"}
I just can't help my devilishly sharp tongue...{#Name="Cent"}
It cuts where it will, even amongst the company of good friends!{#Name="Cent"}
So sorry! Ah ha ha ha!{#Name="Cent"}
I gotta say, I wasn't expecting you to stick with me for so long.{#Name="Zero"}
Well, being free isn't really freedom, is it?{#Name="Dito"}
Wow. Deep. So deep. My mind, it is blown!{#Name="Cent"}
Shut up before I kill you!{#Name="Dito"}
Or better yet, just die on your own.{#Name="Dito"}
...Now, where were we? Oh, right.{LF}Me hanging with you and all that.{#Name="Dito"}
Honestly, I don't really care why you're running around{LF}doing all this killing and whatnot.{#Name="Dito"}
Personally, I'm having the time of my life here!{#Name="Dito"}
I mean, watching you slash and maim and kill all these{LF}ugly bastards? It's like a five-star vacation in Hell!{#Name="Dito"}
Seriously, I'm loving it. You're the best!{#Name="Dito"}
I dunno if you can really keep up all this slaughter,{LF}but I sure hope you can!{#Name="Dito"}
How are you faring, Lady Zero?{#Name="Decadus"}
I'm fine.{#Name="Zero"}
But...your eye...{#Name="Decadus"}
I'm fine, so stop worrying. You're starting to piss me off.{#Name="Zero"}
Unnngh... Your words are...deliciously painful...{#Name="Decadus"}
Your flower has grown ever more beautiful.{LF}Frighteningly so...{#Name="Decadus"}
Are you really gonna kill all your sisters, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
That's the plan.{#Name="Zero"}
But why? You really want their Intoner powers that bad?{#Name="Mikhail"}
I mean, what are you gonna do with all that power, anyway?{#Name="Mikhail"}
I'm going to end it. I'm going to end it once and for all.{#Name="Zero"}
Zero...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey.{#Name="Zero"}
Huh? What is it?{#Name="Mikhail"}
I need to tell you something.{#Name="Zero"}
Uh oh. You sound serious.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I take it you've noticed your...cravings by now.{#Name="Zero"}
...Huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Wh-What do you mean?{#Name="Mikhail"}
I know how you look at all of us. Intoners, I mean.{#Name="Zero"}
No! That's not true! I don't look like that at all!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Don't worry, it's fine.{#Name="Zero"}
That's just how dragons are made.{#Name="Zero"}
But...but Zero, I...{#Name="Mikhail"}
I...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Enough talk. It's time.{#Name="Zero"}
The final battle awaits.{#Name="Zero"}
