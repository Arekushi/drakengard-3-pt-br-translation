ここまでだ{#Name="ゼロ"}
今、なんと？{#Name="オクタ"}
お前達はここまででいい{#Name="ゼロ"}
ここから先は私だけで行く{#Name="ゼロ"}
そんな……我々の事をお気遣いでしたら{#Name="デカート"}
違う{#Name="ゼロ"}
お前達使徒は、ウタウタイの力が無ければ人の形を維持出来ない{#Name="ゼロ"}
いずれ、消えてしまうんだ{#Name="ゼロ"}
だからその前に{#Name="ゼロ"}
元の姿に戻れ{#Name="ゼロ"}
さよなら{#Name="ゼロ"}
楽しかったよ……{#Name="ゼロ"}
Head for the Cathedral.{#Name="説明文"}
Defeat the Imps!{#Name="説明文"}
Defeat the Gray Cerberus!{#Name="説明文"}
I give up... She's too strong for us... We'll never beat her...{#Name="Soldier G"}
Don't you dare wimp out on us!{#Name="Soldier B"}
It's time for a full-scale attack!{#Name="Soldier A"}
It's finally come to this...{#Name="Soldier E"}
How could she have advanced this far?{#Name="Soldier C"}
She's an Intoner! Intoners are the real deal, man!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Retreat is not an option! Why the hell do you think we're here!?{#Name="Soldier F"}
He's right! We fight to the end! For Lady One's sake!{#Name="Soldier G"}
We must become as a shield for our Lady!{#Name="Soldier A"}
It's the only way to repay our savior!{#Name="Soldier A"}
それが、我々を救ってくださったワン様への…恩返しだ{#Name="兵士Ａ"}
Zero! You abominable demon!{#Name="Soldier B"}
まさに、忌まわしき災い！{#Name="兵士Ｂ"}
Chin up, people!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Chin up? We're gonna DIE!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Then face your death with a stout heart!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Stay back. I'll be your shield!{#Name="Soldier F"}
A-Are you sure?{#Name="Soldier G"}
Veteran soldiers should be beacons of hope for the young. Now get behind me!{#Name="Soldier F"}
And please...save Lady One for me. For us all.{#Name="Soldier F"}
This is it, men! Give it your all!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Captain! Our numbers are—{#Name="Soldier C"}
Our numbers are just fine! Now fiiight!{#Name="Soldier A"}
了解！{#Name="兵士Ｃ"}
ヤツら全員狂ってます！{#Name="兵士Ｇ"}
戦場とは、そういうヤツらと向き合う場所さ{#Name="兵士Ｅ"}
No... Noooooo!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Keep moving!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Rear support!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Got it! Requesting backup now!{#Name="Soldier D"}
D-Damn! Don't fall back! Don't fall...back...{#Name="Soldier A"}
Captain!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Keep moving!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Sir! We have nowhere left to go!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Are we even hurting them!?{#Name="Soldier C"}
We must have done SOME damage by now!{LF}...Right!?{#Name="Soldier D"}
We should have known mere humans{LF}couldn't combat an Intoner...{#Name="Soldier C"}
Well, we've made our bed now, so keep fighting!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Come on, move! Goddammit, you stupid legs, MOVE!{#Name="Soldier B"}
This is such a drag! Can we just kill everyone{LF}and get the hell outta here already?{#Name="Dito"}
I'm sure you can tell by my face,{LF}but I'm what you might call...delicate.{#Name="Cent"}
Well, it has been a long battle.{LF}Are you starting to slow down?{#Name="Octa"}
Heavens no! Don't mistake this laid-back{LF}ease of mine for laziness, mmm?{#Name="Cent"}
 {#Name="セント"}
We must keep Lady Zero safe!{#Name="Decadus"}
I'm pretty sure "Lady Zero" can{LF}watch her own ass just fine.{#Name="Dito"}
Hell, if anything, she should be protecting US!{#Name="Dito"}
どっちかっつーと、{LF}こっちがゼロに守ってもらいたいくらいだ{#Name="ディト"}
Don't say such things!{LF}We must give all for our Intoner!{#Name="Decadus"}
I detect the putrid breath of{LF}soldiers quaking in fear.{#Name="Decadus"}
Trivia time! Did you know sixteen percent of{LF}human breath consists of harmful chemicals?{#Name="Cent"}
I... No, I've never heard that.{#Name="Decadus"}
I wouldn't think so. This is my{LF}first time hearing it too.{#Name="Cent"}
How is it that I keep ending up fighting{LF}these stupid battles again?{#Name="Dito"}
Oh ho ho! It's all for Lady Zero, of course.{#Name="Octa"}
The simple truth is, we're all completely{LF}helpless against her charms...{#Name="Octa"}
You gotta be kiddin' me...{#Name="Dito"}
*Huff, huff...*{#Name="Zero"}
Zero, are you okay? The flower's{LF}force is getting stronger!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Keep...going...{#Name="Zero"}
But...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Shut up and keep going no matter what!{LF}You hear me!?{#Name="Zero"}
You rotten dog... I'll kill ya!{LF}And then I'll kill ya again!{#Name="Dito"}
Despite all your anti-social bluster,{LF}Dito, I see you're still fighting hard.{#Name="Decadus"}
Eh, I figure I might as well help Z{LF}out as long as I'm here.{#Name="Dito"}
You see, Dito? The power of genuine{LF}friendship conquers all!{#Name="Decadus"}
Yeah, yeah. Don't get your panties in a{LF}bunch about it. You're creepin' me out.{#Name="Dito"}
Goodness. Whatever are we to do now?{#Name="Cent"}
I shall follow Lady Zero to the ends of the earth.{#Name="Octa"}
What if you die?{#Name="Cent"}
Then I shall ascend to heaven{LF}without regrets! Oh ho ho!{#Name="Octa"}
You may laugh at this, but I dream{LF}of one day living in peace.{#Name="Decadus"}
Yet...the bitter truth does not escape me.{LF}I know in my heart that I was born for combat.{#Name="Decadus"}
I am a disciple, created only to serve an Intoner.{#Name="Decadus"}
I agree. Completely.{#Name="Octa"}
Then how about you both shut up{LF}and make with the killin'!{#Name="Dito"}
You stole the words right from my beautiful mouth!{#Name="Cent"}
Well, this is it.{#Name="Zero"}
It's what, my lady?{#Name="Octa"}
I won't be needing you anymore.{#Name="Zero"}
I can handle the rest by myself.{#Name="Zero"}
M-My Lady, please, if you're worried about us, we—{#Name="Decadus"}
No.{#Name="Zero"}
It's unavoidable. Disciples can't remain{LF}in human form without an Intoner's power.{#Name="Zero"}
Sooner or later, you'll disappear.{#Name="Zero"}
So before that happens...{#Name="Zero"}
I'm giving you your old forms back.{#Name="Zero"}
...Goodbye.{#Name="Zero"}
Zero's actually here!? But how!?{#Name="Soldier F"}
All soldiers, take position!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Oh ho! It seems the enemy's anxious to go out {LF}in a blaze of glory!{#Name="Octa"}
Head for the Cathedral.{#Name="ディト"}
Contact lost with second unit!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Stand strong and protect the gates! Fight!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Aaargh! I'm hit! Someone...avenge me...{#Name="Soldier C"}
No! Wait! Stay alive!{LF}Hey, we need a medic over here!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Once we clear these soldiers out,{LF}the Cathedral should be close.{#Name="Decadus"}
Hmm? Are you asking for help from little old me?{#Name="Cent"}
Well, it does make sense to use{LF}the best arrow in your quiver.{#Name="Cent"}
I knew you'd come crawling to{LF}dear old Cent eventually!{#Name="Cent"}
Octa? Can I ask you a favor?{#Name="Decadus"}
Ignoring me, eh? Such bashfulness{LF}really is unbecoming...{#Name="Cent"}
Is he dead? Hey, hey, is he dead?{LF}Whoa, look at all the blood!{#Name="Dito"}
Ha ha! Do me a favor and skip the medics,{LF}would you?{#Name="Dito"}
Great. Another freak of nature.{#Name="Zero"}
Flying beasts. Imps, I would imagine.{#Name="Octa"}
They say they feast on the livers of humans.{#Name="Octa"}
That's quite the habit they've got there.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh ho! It seems the enemy's anxious{LF}to go out in a blaze of glory!{#Name="Octa"}
Well then, let's not disappoint the bastards!{#Name="Dito"}
