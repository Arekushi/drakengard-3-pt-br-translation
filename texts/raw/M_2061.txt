Being high up like this is nice, huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
If you like freezing.{#Name="Zero"}
Really? You're cold? It feels great to me.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah, well, I'm not covered in scales and blubber.{#Name="Zero"}
Uuurp... This is bad...{#Name="Zero"}
What's wrong, Zero, did a wyvern get you?{LF}...Stupid wyverns!{#Name="Mikhail"}
No. You smell so bad, I think{LF}I'm gonna horf my lunch.{#Name="Zero"}
It's okay to barf on me, Zero!{LF}I don't mind!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Are you kidding me?{#Name="Zero"}
No wonder you reek so bad.{#Name="Zero"}
Ha ha! Thanks!{#Name="Mikhail"}
That wasn't a compliment!{#Name="Zero"}
Wow. You're actually holding your{LF}own against these wyverns.{#Name="Dito"}
Who, me? Are you complimenting me!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
I guess dragons are pretty strong after all, huh?{#Name="Dito"}
Hee heeeeee! You got that right!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey! Quit wagging your tail!{LF}You'll go off-balance.{#Name="Zero"}
And Dito, shut the hell up down there!{LF}You're not helping.{#Name="Zero"}
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!{#Name="Dito"}
Boy, those are some thick clouds up ahead.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Weird. ...A little TOO weird.{#Name="Zero"}
Zero! It's snowing too hard to see up ahead!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Nnngh...{#Name="Zero"}
Should we try going around it?{LF}What do we do, Zero? ...Zero!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Agh! ...Dammit. It's so cold,{LF}I think my brain just froze.{#Name="Zero"}
Well, snap out of it! We've still got{LF}dirty stinking wyverns to kill!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey, dummy... Why are you flying{LF}with your mouth open?{#Name="Zero"}
Um...because then the snow goes in there?{#Name="Mikhail"}
...And?{#Name="Zero"}
And, um...it's cold and it's yummy and it's...fun?{#Name="Mikhail"}
...AND?{#Name="Zero"}
I...I'm sorry! I'll focus on the battle!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Dammit, I can't see anything out here...{#Name="Zero"}
あ。ゼロさん、あぶない！{#Name="ディト"}
ふー。間一髪か……。空中戦は気配を察することが難しいな{#Name="ゼロ"}
I guess we'll be seeing Four soon, huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah. She's got nowhere left to run.{#Name="Zero"}
Well, try to talk to her, okay?{#Name="Mikhail"}
What?{#Name="Zero"}
You're sisters! If you guys talk, you might{LF}be able to understand each other better!{#Name="Mikhail"}
We don't NEED to understand each other better.{#Name="Zero"}
Four's gonna be with her disciple, right?{#Name="Dito"}
Probably.{#Name="Zero"}
I imagine that guy's got some serious issues.{#Name="Zero"}
I dunno, you think? Maybe he's just{LF}forced to be there like I was.{#Name="Dito"}
僕みたいに{LF}しぶしぶウタヒメと一緒にいるのかもよ？{#Name="ディト"}
...Yeah, but you did the deed with Five, right?{#Name="Zero"}
Uuuugh...{#Name="Dito"}
It was awful, being knocked around by{LF}those giant punching bags every night...{#Name="Dito"}
Liar. You loved it.{#Name="Zero"}
You loved having her on her knees, begging you{LF}for more. It's written all over your face.{#Name="Zero"}
Bullshit it is!{#Name="Dito"}
Heh... He's got a temper, eh?{#Name="Zero"}
Why are you mad at Four, Zero? Is it personal?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Personal?{#Name="Zero"}
Like, did she steal your ice cream{LF}as a kid or whatever?{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's not about that. I just want her dead.{#Name="Zero"}
But why!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
All sisters want to kill each other.{LF}Most just don't follow through.{#Name="Zero"}
Seriously? THAT'S Four's daemon?{#Name="Zero"}
Looks more like a goddamn castle.{#Name="Zero"}
Look at all those cannons on the perimeter...{#Name="Zero"}
Circle in from below!{#Name="Zero"}
I can't! I can't!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Why not!?{#Name="Zero"}
Those square ring thingies are magic!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Her song's power is making it hard for me to fly!{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's pulling me in!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Great. Now we gotta take out{LF}all these freaking cannons...{#Name="Zero"}
You just love messing with me,{LF}don't you, Four!{#Name="Zero"}
Why, my sister? Why do you hate me so?{#Name="Four"}
I don't hate you. I just want to kill you.{#Name="Zero"}
But, why!? I don't understand!{#Name="Four"}
I feel kinda bad for her...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Shut it, would you!?{#Name="Zero"}
Zero, please! Snap out of this!{#Name="Four"}
Where's the kind, gentle Zero I once knew?{#Name="Four"}
Beats me. I've always been like this.{#Name="Zero"}
Just stop this already, Zero!{#Name="Four"}
Sorry. No can do.{#Name="Zero"}
I can't fight you, Zero.{LF}I don't want to fight you!{#Name="Four"}
Fine by me. Then I'll kill you without a fight.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, God... Someone, please...{LF}Wake me from this nightmare...{#Name="Four"}
Four and Decadus both seem like good people...{LF}I don't want to kill them.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Save it for someone who gives a shit.{#Name="Zero"}
No, really! Look at us! If anyone's{LF}a bad guy here, it's us!{#Name="Mikhail"}
So, what? I can only kill evil people now?{LF}Is that what you're saying?{#Name="Zero"}
Guess what? In real life,{LF}bad guys win all the time.{#Name="Zero"}
So quit bitching about your happy{LF}fantasy world before I kill you, too.{#Name="Zero"}
うらあああっ！フォウ、どこだァ？出てこい！{#Name="ゼロ"}
砲台は邪魔だ！邪魔だ！邪魔だ！{LF}邪魔だ！邪魔だ！邪魔だ～～～ッ！{#Name="ゼロ"}
どんだけ逃げりゃ気がすむんだ？{#Name="ゼロ"}
おとなしく死ねッ！{#Name="ゼロ"}
Almost there!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Sit still, Sister. There's nowhere left to run!{#Name="Zero"}
ナントカ山上空{#Name="説明文"}
Destroy all of Armaros' eyes!{#Name="説明文"}
Defeat Armaros!{#Name="説明文"}
全てのアルマロスの瞳を撃破した！{#Name="説明文"}
アルマロスを撃破した！{#Name="説明文"}
お。おい！フォウが逃げるぞ！{#Name="ゼロ"}
ダメだよ！ゼロ！アルマロスが倒せない！{#Name="ミハイル"}
予備{#Name="予備"}
ゼロッ！{#Name="ミハイル"}
よし、ここまでで充分だ。{#Name="ゼロ"}
えっ？　ゼロ！　どこへ行く気！？{#Name="ミハイル"}
Zero... At last, my wayward sister finally arrives.{#Name="Four"}
Yeah, it took a while.{#Name="Zero"}
All your chickenshit running around didn't help.{LF}Sit still so I can kill you quick.{#Name="Zero"}
I...I have no wish to fight you, Sister.{#Name="Four"}
Oh?{#Name="Zero"}
Don't you know how much I admire you, Zero? I always have!{#Name="Four"}
This can't end in bloodshed! It can't!{#Name="Four"}
You bet your ass it can! You think I came{LF}all the way here for a fucking picnic?{#Name="Zero"}
I'm not leaving until I've strewn your{LF}virgin guts all over the goddamned snow!{#Name="Zero"}
You can't... You can't...{#Name="Four"}
You caaaaaaaaaaaan't!{#Name="Four"}
Behold the fourth song:{#Name="Decadus"}
Impenetrable Shield of Antiquity!{#Name="Decadus"}
The rare power granted to our own...{#Name="Decadus"}
The stout citadel that protects us...{#Name="Decadus"}
Cast your blighted sins upon these very skies!{#Name="Decadus"}
I, Decadus, summon thee in my name...{#Name="Decadus"}
Armaros, uphold!{#Name="Decadus"}
Remember when those boys used to bully me, Zero?{#Name="Four"}
I would cry, and you'd stay with me{LF}until I felt better...{#Name="Four"}
I think you got the wrong girl.{#Name="Zero"}
No! That's who you really are! You must remember!{#Name="Four"}
We must find a way to make peace!{LF}For that precious dragon's sake, if nothing else.{#Name="Four"}
 {#Name="フォウ"}
Will you shut up already!?{#Name="Zero"}
If I die here, my disciple will soon follow.{#Name="Four"}
An Intoner and her disciple{LF}are united by a mystical bond!{#Name="Four"}
A mystical bond? It's called sex.{LF}There's nothing mystical about it.{#Name="Zero"}
 {#Name="Four"}
Don't... Don't say such things to me, Sister!{#Name="Four"}
Besides, your disciple will be fine.{LF}After you die, I'll just ball his brains out.{#Name="Zero"}
Stooooooppp iiitttttt!{#Name="Four"}
How long do you plan to keep running, Four?{#Name="Zero"}
Just lay down and die already!{#Name="Zero"}
You can never defeat me, Sister!{#Name="Four"}
Really? You saying you don't have ANY weaknesses?{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, all of us have weaknesses.{LF}But I will never reveal mine.{#Name="Four"}
That's because I can keep myself{LF}calm...unlike you.{#Name="Four"}
We'll see about that, you little prude.{#Name="Zero"}
Wha!?{#Name="Four"}
Tell me, are you saving yourself?{LF}Or do you just stink down there?{#Name="Zero"}
Stop! Stop it! Don't say that!{LF}Don't say such things!{#Name="Four"}
よしっ！全部破壊したなっ！{#Name="ゼロ"}
She's getting away!{#Name="Zero"}
Goddamn, she's stubborn!{#Name="Zero"}
Time's up, Four.{#Name="Zero"}
If you want to say a little something before you go, now's the time.{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Four"}
I...I won't let you harm Lady Four!{#Name="Decadus"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
Stop... S-Stop... I have to...kill her!{#Name="Zero"}
N-No...{#Name="Zero"}
Don't come out... Not now...{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
...Where am I?{#Name="Zero"}
Z-Zero?{#Name="Four"}
Four?{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Decadus"}
Why am I... What's going on?{LF}...Where are we?{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, Zero!{#Name="Four"}
{06}>{#Name="Decadus"}
You're here! You came back! It's really you, isn't it!?{#Name="Four"}
What happened? What about our sisters? Where are they?{#Name="Zero"}
Everything's going to be okay.{LF}We don't have to fight anymore, Zero.{#Name="Four"}
Everyone else is waiting for you.{#Name="Four"}
...Where are they waiting?{#Name="Zero"}
Three's in the Land of Forests, and Two's in the Land of Sands.{LF}They're both—{#Name="Four"}
Thanks for the info.{#Name="Zero"}
N-No... I thought you were...back...{#Name="Four"}
I can't believe you fell for that bullshit!{#Name="Zero"}
You honestly thought I'd have a split personality!?{#Name="Zero"}
Stupid son of a{#Name="Zero"}
BITCH!{#Name="Zero"}
Please. Kill me as well.{#Name="Decadus"}
I kill my sisters. I TAKE their men.{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Decadus"}
Go clean up. Front AND rear. We meet tonight.{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Decadus"}
Front...AND rear?{#Name="Decadus"}
So who's next? Three, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Decadus"}
Two Intoners down...three to go.{#Name="Zero"}
...Wait a second. Dummy, come here.{#Name="Zero"}
Huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Don't you look...different from before?{#Name="Zero"}
Different? ...GYA!{LF}What the heck!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Whoa.{#Name="Zero"}
Whoooa!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Whoooooooooa.{#Name="Zero"}
...Lots of wyverns around here.{#Name="Zero"}
Must be Four's song at work.{#Name="Zero"}
Stupid wyverns. Just a buncha{LF}low-class dragon wannabes!{#Name="Mikhail"}
They can't even talk!{LF}Or understand language!{#Name="Mikhail"}
And don't get me started{LF}on those pathetic wings...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Come on! Let's roast these wyverns!{LF}Let's roast 'em ALL!{#Name="Mikhail"}
...Wow. You're like a different beast{LF}when you're talking about wyverns.{#Name="Zero"}
Ha ha! Thanks!{#Name="Mikhail"}
That wasn't a compliment.{#Name="Zero"}
What's that?{#Name="Zero"}
Looks like a rock.{#Name="Mikhail"}
...They're attacking us with ROCKS?{#Name="Zero"}
See? I told you wyverns were stupid!{#Name="Mikhail"}
That really means something coming from you...{#Name="Zero"}
Zero! We're gonna get sucked in!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Just stay calm and watch where you're aiming!{#Name="Zero"}
Take down that tower! It's pulling you in!{#Name="Zero"}
Hurry up and destroy it before{LF}it pulls you in completely!{#Name="Zero"}
The target's too small! It's hard to hit!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Damn it, Four. Could you BE more annoying?{#Name="Zero"}
Urrrgh... It's moving too fast for me to hit!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Shut up and keep firing! She's getting away!{#Name="Zero"}
Don't let her get away!{#Name="Zero"}
It's no good, Zero! We can't beat him!{LF}We can't beat him!{#Name="Mikhail"}
クソッ。魔力が集まってる……{LF}さっさと倒さないとマズイぞっ！{#Name="ゼロ"}
うああああっ！{#Name="ゼロ"}
くそっ！フォウに逃げられる……！{#Name="ゼロ"}
Destroy the flying fortress.{#Name="目的文"}
