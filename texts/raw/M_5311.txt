I hesitate to even think it! We must put a stop to her!{#Name="Soldier F"}

So this is One's home base, is it?{#Name="Zero"}
I'm fine! Go get that guy! {#Name="Zero"}
Right! Be careful, Zero! Be careful, okay?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Stop repeating yourself!{#Name="Zero"}
My name is Zero, the original Intoner, and the immortal—{#Name="Zero"}
KNOCK IT OFF! I'm trying to make a speech here!{#Name="Zero"}
Now... Uh...{#Name="Zero"}
Oh for fuck's sake! Now I lost my place!{#Name="Zero"}
Think you're ready for me!?{#Name="Soldier A"}
Ha! That's so cute.{#Name="Zero"}
The only way through here is over our dead bodies!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Oh ho! Is that really the kind of thing you{LF}want to say to an Intoner and her disciple?{#Name="Octa"}
Hold her off as long as you can!{LF}Lady One's counting on us!{#Name="Soldier E"}
She'll be counting your bodies soon!{#Name="Zero"}
ワン様には指一本触れさせない！{#Name="兵士G"}
She'll be counting your bodies soon!{#Name="Zero"}
Nnngh...{#Name="Zero"}
Are you okay, Zero? Are you okay!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Stop repeating things, dammit!{#Name="Zero"}
But your flower...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Look. You just worry about killing One.{#Name="Zero"}
She's a powerful foe.{#Name="Zero"}
She keeps her magic sealed inside{LF}her by pure will alone—{#Name="Zero"}
That's how she's managed to stay sane.{#Name="Zero"}
And you won't be able to beat her{LF}if you keep getting distracted!{#Name="Zero"}
But—{#Name="Mikhail"}
No buts!{#Name="Zero"}
アイツ……ワンは最強なんだ{#Name="ゼロ"}
ゼロより強いの！？{#Name="ミハイル"}
まさか！　私よりは弱い。弱いハズ。だから、大丈夫だ{#Name="ゼロ"}
One!{#Name="Zero"}
You think you're the only one who can fix things?{#Name="One"}
The world doesn't need Intoners!{#Name="One"}
Heh. I completely agree.{#Name="Zero"}
Then die already!{#Name="One"}
You first, Sis!{#Name="Zero"}
I can eradicate the Intoners as easily as you can!{#Name="One"}
Like I can trust you? I have to do this myself!{#Name="Zero"}
You should talk! You gave birth to this curse!{#Name="One"}
Whether we have the same goal or not,{#Name="One"}
I swear by my murdered sisters' souls...{#Name="One"}
I will never forgive you! Now DIE!{#Name="One"}
Die, die, die, DIIIIIIE!{#Name="One"}
Heh. I never asked for forgiveness.{#Name="Zero"}
So quit all your fucking yapping...{#Name="Zero"}
and die for me already, One!{#Name="Zero"}
Recording: M5310_E0040_GM{#Name="Accord"}
The flower's defenses created{LF}five sisters from Zero's body.{#Name="Accord"}
At first, they were simply corpses{LF}controlled by the flower.{#Name="Accord"}
But soon, they gained self-awareness{LF}and began to act of their own free will.{#Name="Accord"}
If the flower isn't destroyed, mankind{LF}has no future in this branch.{#Name="Accord"}
Some of us are of the opinion that this{LF}branch should be sealed off at once,{#Name="Accord"}
but I disagree.{#Name="Accord"}
I think at least one of them{LF}might be able to accomplish it...{#Name="Accord"}
...No. I should stop. {#Name="Accord"}
I'll erase this entry and hand the recording{LF}off to the next pass in its current state.{#Name="Accord"}

I thought you...weren't going to interfere.{#Name="Zero"}

This went...a little different...than I had planned...{#Name="Accord"}
However...{#Name="Accord"}
I think this way was...more human...wasn't it?{#Name="Accord"}
Yeah. I guess.{#Name="Zero"}
Zero... Please...{#Name="Accord"}
I'm...a little...tired.{#Name="Accord"}
Good night, Accord. Tell the Old World I said hi.{#Name="Zero"}

The final entry in my recording draws near.{#Name="Accord"}
No matter what conclusion awaits us at the end of this branch,{#Name="Accord"}
I know that I will never forget this journey...{#Name="Accord"}
But...what about you, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
I don't wanna kill you...{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's all right.{#Name="Zero"}
Everybody dies at some point.{#Name="Zero"}

So you're just helping me close the book. {#Name="Zero"}
Aww man...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Zero...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Now what? Don't you dare wuss out on me...{#Name="Zero"}
No, I'm... I'm gonna do this, Zero.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I mean, I'll try real hard.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I don't understand this, and{LF}I don't know if it's right...{#Name="Mikhail"}
But I'm gonna try!{#Name="Mikhail"}
I mean, I...I may not ever{LF}see you again, right?{#Name="Mikhail"}
This... This may be the last time...{#Name="Mikhail"}
This may be the last time we{LF}ever get to be together...{#Name="Mikhail"}
So I want to help you, Zero. I want to help...{#Name="Mikhail"}
...Thanks.{#Name="Zero"}

Listen, Octa and I will take care of One!{#Name="Zero"}
But in the meantime, I need you{LF}to take out that dragon!{#Name="Zero"}
Okay, Zero! I'll do it for you!{#Name="Mikhail"}
