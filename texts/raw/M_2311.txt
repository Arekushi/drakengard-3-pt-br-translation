Lady Four must remain safe!{#Name="Soldier A"}
I won't let that wench lay a finger on her!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Protect Lady Four with your lives!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Don't let Zero inside Lady Four's citadel!{#Name="Soldier C"}
The citadel up ahead, eh?{LF}Thanks for the directions, chump.{#Name="Zero"}
Dammit! Kill that woman!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Lady Four stays with us!{#Name="Soldier F"}
It's just Four, Four, Four all day{LF}with you idiots, isn't it?{#Name="Zero"}
I can't believe you fall for{LF}that cutesy act of hers.{#Name="Zero"}
Don't you dare stain Lady Four{LF}with that rotten flower of yours!{#Name="Soldier E"}
If you're that infatuated with Four,{LF}I'll make sure you die together!{#Name="Zero"}
Dito! Lady Zero requires further support!{#Name="Decadus"}
Not happening!{#Name="Dito"}
Oh ho ho! Unable to fully perform, eh?{#Name="Octa"}
Sometimes old-timers have that{LF}problem with their man-bananas!{#Name="Octa"}
Gah! Shut up already!{#Name="Dito"}
If your man-banana's so tough,{LF}why don't you fight with it, huh?{#Name="Dito"}
Unnnnngh...{#Name="Decadus"}
And you! Freakshow! Stop imagining it!{#Name="Dito"}
You know... Endurance is key to{LF}surviving a battle such as this.{#Name="Cent"}
I, of course, will be fine, what{LF}with my perfect body and all...{#Name="Cent"}
Not to mention my ravishing good looks!{#Name="Cent"}
The hell do looks have to do with anything?{#Name="Dito"}
Anything? Looks have to do with EVERYTHING!{#Name="Cent"}
Don't blame me just because you're ugly as sin.{#Name="Cent"}
What'd you say!?{#Name="Dito"}
Leave it, Dito! Concentrate on the battle!{#Name="Decadus"}
I swear to everything that's holy,{LF}I will kill that man.{#Name="Dito"}
*Huff, huff...*{#Name="Zero"}
Are you all right, my lady? You appear fatigued.{#Name="Decadus"}
Forget about it. I'm fine.{#Name="Zero"}
Hmm... I wager the magic within{LF}your flower is growing stronger.{#Name="Octa"}
If I had to guess, I'd say the{LF}blossom is absorbing your—{#Name="Octa"}
Let's go!{#Name="Zero"}
Lady Zero does a good job of hiding it...{#Name="Octa"}
But something is rotten with that flower of hers.{#Name="Octa"}
It's not rotten! It's as beautiful as the dawn!{#Name="Cent"}
Ho ho! You misunderstand.{LF}I mean only that it is...suspicious.{#Name="Octa"}
Perhaps there's more to it{LF}than meets the eye, mmm?{#Name="Octa"}
Oooh! Riiight. Now I get it.{#Name="Cent"}
You do?{#Name="Octa"}
Ha ha ha! Of course!{#Name="Cent"}
She's worried her little accessory{LF}will go out of style!{#Name="Cent"}
Er...right. {#Name="Octa"}
This journey is turning out to be{LF}more difficult than I'd expected.{#Name="Decadus"}
Seriously? What exactly were you expecting?{#Name="Dito"}
You're traveling with ZERO!{LF}She's like a murder machine.{#Name="Dito"}
I suppose it has been one massacre{LF}after another... Ungh...{#Name="Decadus"}
Tucker down there, tiger.{#Name="Dito"}
That was not a moan of pleasure!{#Name="Decadus"}
What will Lady Zero do once{LF}the Intoners are no more?{#Name="Decadus"}
How would I know? And why would I care?{#Name="Dito"}
Right now, there's lots of killin' goin'{LF}on, and that's all I really need.{#Name="Dito"}
You shall not be forgiven, Zero!{#Name="Soldier A"}
All that befell our poor Lady Four{LF}is your fault, demon!{#Name="Soldier B"}
I shall serve Lady Four, no matter{LF}what has become of her!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Dammit! Our pure, unblemished Intoner is no more!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Stay strong! It's up to us to save{LF}Lady Four from her lost ways!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Four's up ahead. Let's go.{#Name="Zero"}
Divergence: Branch D{#Name="127"}
A single decision can change everything.{#Name="235"}
So what do Zero's decisions mean for this world?{#Name="253"}
Will they bring about salvation? Or destruction?{#Name="127"}
There is one last branch to follow,{#Name="145"}
and it begins in the Land of Mountains.{#Name="145"}
