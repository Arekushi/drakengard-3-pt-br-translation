Long ago, in an age tarnished by endless conflict,{#Name="Old Man"}
five beautiful goddesses descended upon the land.{#Name="Old Man"}
The goddesses sang mystical songs that restored{LF}peace and harmony to our broken world.{#Name="Old Man"}
The people began to worship these holy songstresses,{#Name="Old Man"}
and came to refer to them as "Intoners."{#Name="Old Man"}
Thanks to the efforts of these Intoners,{LF}the chaos of war became a distant memory.{#Name="Old Man"}
And as a result, mankind enjoyed an age of sweet reverie,{#Name="Old Man"}
basking in the newfound light and beau—{#Name="Old Man"}
Y-You...murderous savage...{#Name="Old Man"}
Savage? I think you mean Intoner.{#Name="Zero"}
She's in there! Take her down!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Kill the traitorous demon!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Michael...{#Name="Zero"}
It's time...to put an end to the Intoners.{#Name="Zero"}

Zero! Go! Defeat your sisters!{#Name="Michael"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
No! You don't have the strength for this!{#Name="Zero"}
These puppets are no match for a dragon!{#Name="Michael"}
Fine. Just don't die on me.{#Name="Zero"}
Farewell, fool...{#Name="Michael"}
All of you...{#Name="Zero"}
Women, children, the elderly... It doesn't matter.{LF}If you stand in my way, you're gonna die.{#Name="Zero"}
343{#Name="343"}
If that's what you want...then get in line!{#Name="Zero"}
It's her! It's Zero!{#Name="Soldier A"}
She looks so sinister... Is she really an Intoner?{#Name="Soldier F"}
Hyaaaa! Look sharp, men! Keep our Intoners safe!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Fight smart! Dying here accomplishes nothing!{#Name="Soldier E"}
The dragon's too strong!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Somebody help me!{#Name="Soldier D"}
A war between Intoners... Truly the world has gone mad.{#Name="Soldier F"}
It's over... We're all going to die...{#Name="Soldier G"}
Keep it up! Don't lose hope!{#Name="Soldier F"}
No retreat! Zero must be stopped!{#Name="Soldier A"}
The demon's trying to kill her sisters!{#Name="Soldier B"}

No... Dammit, no!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Ugh. She's so strong!{#Name="Soldier A"}
At this rate, she's gonna reach the Intoners soon!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Never. We must protect them with our lives!{#Name="Soldier A"}
How can we stand against an Intoner and a dragon?{#Name="Soldier E"}
What choice do we have!? All men, take position! Attaaack!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Your grave beckons, apostate!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Die, you damned traitorous Intoner!{#Name="Soldier G"}
I might take you more seriously if your voice{LF}wasn't quivering...{#Name="Zero"}
Why is an Intoner killing her own?{#Name="Soldier A"}
Shall we tell them? They seem genuinely curious.{#Name="Michael"}
Why bother? They're about to die anyway.{#Name="Zero"}
The end of the world is nigh...{#Name="Soldier F"}
343{#Name="343"}
They...they told me Intoners were{LF}supposed to be peaceful!{#Name="Soldier E"}
What kind of crap are they teaching{LF}you people these days?{#Name="Zero"}
Get a medic! This crazy Intoner's gonna kill us all!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Sure, why not? I haven't killed any medics yet.{#Name="Zero"}
Get outta my way, dammit!{#Name="Zero"}
Be calm, Zero. Anger will only slow your sword.{#Name="Michael"}
Look, I know that, it's just... Ah, forget it!{#Name="Zero"}
Michael! Take 'em out!{#Name="Zero"}
As you wish.{#Name="Michael"}
Where the hell are my sisters?{#Name="Zero"}
Are you certain about this, Zero?{LF}About slaying all the Intoners?{#Name="Michael"}
Of course. Why else would I be stabbing everyone?{#Name="Zero"}
Damned...traitorous...Intoner!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Do you hear that? They all name you traitor.{#Name="Michael"}
I've been called worse.{#Name="Zero"}
Kill the foul beast! Bring it down!{#Name="Soldier B"}
They view me as some kind of monster.{#Name="Michael"}
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm doing nothing of the sort.{#Name="Michael"}
Heh. You always were the sensitive type.{#Name="Zero"}
I am nothing of the sort!{#Name="Michael"}
Oh, hell. What's this thing?{#Name="Zero"}
It's no human... And yet, not quite a beast.{#Name="Michael"}
Likely some sort of automaton devised by{LF}the Intoners.{#Name="Michael"}
Crafty little bastards...{#Name="Zero"}
Men, take your positions! Stand strong!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Get. Out of. My WAY!{#Name="Zero"}
Don't let her through!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Move!{#Name="Zero"}
