Proceed to the next mission?{#Name=" "}
みんなで一つの場所に集まるデモ{#Name=" "}
...So, you see, dragons have a hunger.{LF}They want to eat Intoners.{#Name="Accord"}
And the stronger an Intoner's magical force,{LF}the stronger that craving becomes.{#Name="Accord"}
That said, some of them do manage to control such longings.{#Name="Accord"}
That's why Mikhail here can stay calm around Zero,{LF}for example.{#Name="Accord"}
Yeah! I can control it! I'm awesome!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hmmm... I still have some unanswered questions.{#Name="Octa"}
True, this explains why dragons seem intent on{LF}devouring Intoners.{#Name="Octa"}
But why would they have such a craving in the first place?{#Name="Octa"}
I'm afraid I can't tell you that.{#Name="Accord"}
So, like, who are you, anyway?{#Name="Dito"}
My name is Accord. I'm a friend of Zero's.{#Name="Accord"}
Liar. I barely know you. {#Name="Zero"}
Is there no way Intoners and dragons{LF}can live at peace with each other?{#Name="Octa"}
Nope. It'd be a waste of time to try.{#Name="Zero"}
Mikhail seems content enough at the moment.{#Name="Octa"}
If he's held it back until now, why would that{LF}change in the future?{#Name="Octa"}
Forget it.{#Name="Zero"}
He's got a role to fulfill in all this. {#Name="Zero"}
What a pity...{#Name="Octa"}
That Accord woman smells simply delightful!{LF}Oh my, yes. Much better than you, Lady Zero. {#Name="Cent"}
That's sweet of you.{#Name="Zero"}
Hey there, beautiful. You make my heart go pitty-pat.{#Name="Cent"}
...Er, ahem. I SAID, you make my heart go pitty-pat.{#Name="Cent"}
Your emotional state and my response to it{LF}is irrelevant to this branch.{#Name="Accord"}
Yeah. See, now you're breaking out the big words...{#Name="Cent"}
Even a smart guy like me is having trouble following.{#Name="Cent"}
But goodness, you certainly are beautiful...{#Name="Cent"}
Of course, you cooould be even more lovely if you wanted.{#Name="Cent"}
Maybe trim the hair... Take off the glasses...{LF}A quick dye job up top...{#Name="Cent"}
Are you trying to make her look like Two?{#Name="Dito"}
Meee? What? No. That's absurd.{#Name="Cent"}
I just want her to look beautiful.{LF}I can't help it if I have a type!{#Name="Cent"}
Who the hell is this chick, anyway?{#Name="Dito"}
You planning to let her join us, Zero?{#Name="Dito"}
Are you kidding?{#Name="Zero"}
Good. I can't stand that type.{#Name="Dito"}
What type?{#Name="Mikhail"}
You know! The type who looks all prim and proper{LF}and whatever.{#Name="Dito"}
The type who walks around like their shit don't stink.{#Name="Dito"}
...The type like Five, okay!? Can't stand 'em.{LF}Makes me wanna puke.{#Name="Dito"}
You're as bad as Cent.{#Name="Zero"}
Just keep her out of my sight.{#Name="Dito"}
Lady Zero, perhaps it would be wise to{LF}keep your distance from Mikhail.{#Name="Decadus"}
Huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
No, it's fine.{#Name="Zero"}
But...{#Name="Decadus"}
I need him.{#Name="Zero"}
Huh!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Well, okay. I don't necessarily need him.{#Name="Zero"}
But I need a dragon, and he's the only one I got.{#Name="Zero"}
I shall follow your lead, my lady, no matter{LF}where it may take me.{#Name="Decadus"}
Hey, Zero! Don't listen to what that weird girl said, okay?{#Name="Mikhail"}
You mean the bit about how you're gonna eat me?{#Name="Zero"}
Yeah! That's mean! I'd never eat you, Zero!{LF}Never!{#Name="Mikhail"}
You sure? I mean, you already eat rotten meat.{LF}It's not like you're picky.{#Name="Zero"}
No way! I bet you taste WAAAY worse than rotten meat!{#Name="Mikhail"}
You really know how to cheer a girl up.{#Name="Zero"}
Look, I'm not gonna eat you, okay?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey. You. Knock off the bullshit, okay?{#Name="Zero"}
The...bullshit?{#Name="Accord"}
Ah. You must be referring to my statement{LF}that Mikhail was going to eat you.{#Name="Accord"}
You don't need to repeat it.{#Name="Zero"}
...Does this scare you?{#Name="Accord"}
Scare me? Hell no.{#Name="Zero"}
One death is as good as another.{#Name="Zero"}
Not that. I'm talking about the idea of losing your friends.{#Name="Accord"}
...I don't have friends. I never have.{#Name="Zero"}
I really have no opinion on the matter.{LF}I'm just here to observe and record.{#Name="Accord"}
What will you do next?{#Name="Accord"}
Track down Three and kill her.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, and if you follow me, I'll kill you too.{#Name="Zero"}
Don't worry. I don't have permission to interfere in battle.{#Name="Accord"}
Well, good then.{#Name="Zero"}
Do take care of yourself.{#Name="Accord"}
This branch you're in is heavily damaged, and the world{LF}will only grow more chaotic as you proceed.{#Name="Accord"}
Thanks for the...tip.{#Name="Zero"}
Of course, that also means there's a greater chance{LF}of saving the world as well...{#Name="Accord"}
The sisters are coming undone.{#Name="Accord"}
Mikhail suddenly evolved two levels at once.{#Name="Accord"}
In the midst of all these anomalies,{#Name="Accord"}
Zero is heading for the Land of Forests.{#Name="Accord"}
