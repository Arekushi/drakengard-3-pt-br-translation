From the moment I was born, there was nothing.{LF}That's how I wound up with the name Zero.{#Name="Zero's Blade Lv. 1"}
I tried and failed to find value in my life.{LF}Even religion failed me, for I would have sooner{LF}fought and killed a god than prayed to it.{#Name="Zero's Blade Lv. 2"}
I took lives and felt nothing. I killed without regret.{LF}Right? Wrong? Sin? Redemption? I couldn't even{LF}work up the energy to care.{#Name="Zero's Blade Lv. 3"}
Like a child, I waited and hoped. Hoped for the moment{LF}when this sad shell of a life would finally be over.{#Name="Zero's Blade Lv. 4"}
He committed a crime. The famine raged, taxes rose without{LF}mercy, and his parents vanished. Soon his siblings grew{LF}gaunt with hunger, and for them, he took action.{#Name="Sinful Scream Lv. 1"}
He committed a crime. He shared the stolen milk and bread{LF}with his five young siblings, allowing himself none.{LF}Instead, he simply watched as they devoured the bounty.{#Name="Sinful Scream Lv. 2"}
He committed a crime. When the rich merchants found him,{LF}he was not allowed to die for his sin. That honor fell to his{LF}siblings, for they alone had consumed the stolen goods.{#Name="Sinful Scream Lv. 3"}
He committed a crime. His siblings' ravaged bodies lay in{LF}the street. He gazed upon them, rubbed the open sores from{LF}his own public whipping, and heaved a voiceless sob.{#Name="Sinful Scream Lv. 4"}
A visitor? Ah, yes. Come hear the song, then. The innkeeper{LF}and her daughter will greet you warmly. Their food and drink{LF}is without compare, and the girl is a feast for the eyes.{#Name="Eternal Voice Lv. 1"}
The girl's song is the best thing about the place. A single{LF}listen will drive all your troubles away. Did you know{LF}she has a sister? Ah, if only they sang a duet...{#Name="Eternal Voice Lv. 2"}
Welcome back, traveler! It's been a while. Come to see the{LF}girls again? You certainly do like them! It's been decades{LF}since I first told you of them, and yet here you are again.{#Name="Eternal Voice Lv. 3"}
What's that, traveler? You wonder why the girls never age?{LF}Ha ha ha! Those are the children of the girls you once knew!{LF}Surely you didn't think they were immortal! ...Did you?{#Name="Eternal Voice Lv. 4"}
The prince I serve was destined to lead our nation.{LF}But alas, we had been nearly destroyed in an unjust war;{LF}betrayed from within, and left to wither and die.{#Name="Ceremonial Blade Lv. 1"}
The prince I serve grew into a strong, handsome young man.{LF}After much grueling toil, he rebuilt our land and became{LF}its king. It was a wonderful, wonderful land.{#Name="Ceremonial Blade Lv. 2"}
But that land is long gone. You will find it on no map.{LF}And my king fell when his nation was defeated.{#Name="Ceremonial Blade Lv. 3"}
My king kept this ceremonial blade close. And to the very{LF}end, he never suspected me. It remains a regret of mine.{LF}...Ah, but no matter. It's just a silly little story now.{#Name="Ceremonial Blade Lv. 4"}
Once there was a hellish wasteland covered by thundering{LF}skies. It changed hands countless times, and its people were{LF}tormented by unending hunger and merciless lightning.{#Name="Thunder Lord Lv. 1"}
One day, a valiant young baron swore to conquer the land{LF}and turn it into a place of bounty. Few of his exhausted{LF}subjects believed him. Some even laughed openly.{#Name="Thunder Lord Lv. 2"}
The baron had forged a fine sword of silver, then ordered a{LF}group of virgins to pray for three days and nights. Atop a hill,{LF}he raised the sword high, then thrust it into the ground.{#Name="Thunder Lord Lv. 3"}
After a stormy night, the skies cleared. The young baron was{LF}gone, and a fruit tree stood on the hill with the silver sword{LF}entangled in its branches. It still rumbles to this day.{#Name="Thunder Lord Lv. 4"}
Once, there were three young girls. Though they lived in an{LF}age when arranged marriages were the standard, they swore{LF}to each other that they would always protect their chastity.{#Name="Virginal Sin Lv. 1"}
One girl cut her beautiful blonde hair and commanded{LF}a battalion in place of her dead brother. She died a fine{LF}death, with her beloved manservant at her side.{#Name="Virginal Sin Lv. 2"}
One girl, a brunette and an avid reader of books, loved{LF}a man from a poor family. Knowing their love could{LF}never be, the couple threw themselves into the sea.{#Name="Virginal Sin Lv. 3"}
The last girl, a flaxen-haired beauty, never knew her{LF}friends had broken their vows of chastity. She remained{LF}a virgin all her life, eventually passing away of old age.{#Name="Virginal Sin Lv. 4"}
The villagers doubted the strange new missionary at first,{LF}but soon his charming words and handsome smile won{LF}them over, and they welcomed him with open arms.{#Name="Saintly Brimstone Lv. 1"}
Beauty was power in the village. The beautiful were royalty,{LF}while the ugly suffered as slaves. Soon, the scarred and{LF}deformed of the village begged the missionary for help.{#Name="Saintly Brimstone Lv. 2"}
Smiling, the missionary raised a hand. In a flash, the ugly{LF}villagers were transformed, their faces all identical to{LF}his own. And yet, his work was not complete...{#Name="Saintly Brimstone Lv. 3"}
Soon, every man, woman, and child looked like the missionary,{LF}right down to the grin. They no longer cried or grew angry,{LF}leaving the village with nothing but grim, hollow smiles.{#Name="Saintly Brimstone Lv. 4"}
My cursed body bleeds once a month like clockwork.{LF}I am thin and weak and more ugly than most. I am, in a word,{LF}different—and people do not take kindly to such.{#Name="Bloodletter Lv. 1"}
Too weak to work, a mere useless husk, I spend my days in{LF}a basement waiting for the abuse I know is sure to come.{LF}...In my dreams, my body no longer bleeds.{#Name="Bloodletter Lv. 2"}
I feel sick. Sick. Sick and queasy. In my dream, the man{LF}who abuses me appears again. But this time, I seize the{LF}weapon he has long used to torment me. {#Name="Bloodletter Lv. 3"}
In the dream, I hit him again and again. And then I see,{LF}for the very first time, that I am not the only one who bleeds.{LF}I am human. Just like him. And this makes me smile.{#Name="Bloodletter Lv. 4"}
One of the villagers was a compulsive liar. He bandied a{LF}sword about carelessly, boasting of his demon-slaying{LF}exploits. Soon, he had lost the trust of all his peers.{#Name="False Pact Lv. 1"}
One day, a traveler arrived asking the way to a lair of{LF}demons. The villagers were silent, but the great liar spoke.{LF}"Have no fear!" he said. "I will lead you to the demons' den!"{#Name="False Pact Lv. 2"}
The man lied and lied, and each time the traveler believed him,{LF}they became more lost. But when the liar finally showed the{LF}true path, he was forced to save the traveler from the demon.{#Name="False Pact Lv. 3"}
"I finally told the truth," said the dying liar, "and now I must{LF}pay for it." The traveler slayed the demon, became a hero,{LF}and has carried his newfound friend's sword ever since.{#Name="False Pact Lv. 4"}

The marble sword was imbued with the blacksmith's{LF}blazing soul. It yearned for an owner who thirsted for blood.{LF}Who pined for battle. Who hungered for war.{#Name="Moonfire Lv. 1"}
But its razor edge emitted searing heat, enough to{LF}reduce to ash any stalwart warrior who wielded it.{#Name="Moonfire Lv. 2"}
The sword waited for a strong soul to tame its boiling{LF}heart. It waited for the warrior who would let blood{LF}spill across its blade.{#Name="Moonfire Lv. 3"}
Even as it took the lives of those it sought, the sword{LF}waited. It waited for a vessel for its soul, and eternity{LF}spread before it like an icy embrace.{#Name="Moonfire Lv. 4"}
One day, a young boy encountered a white horse with blue{LF}eyes by the side of a lush forest spring. Each day he passed{LF}the animal, he stopped to tend to its injured leg.{#Name="Skyward Thunder Lv. 1"}
On the fifth day, the horse allowed the boy to touch its{LF}beautiful white hair. On the tenth day, its deep blue eyes{LF}revealed a hard-won trust. Soon after, the horse vanished.{#Name="Skyward Thunder Lv. 2"}
The boy figured the leg had healed, and regretted missing{LF}his chance to ride the steed. Decades passed. The boy, now a{LF}withered old man, told his grandchildren of the white horse.{#Name="Skyward Thunder Lv. 3"}
Just as the man spoke of the horse, thunder boomed from{LF}the sky and he vanished. Some say they saw a man on a{LF}white horse amid the lightning, storming off to the heavens.{#Name="Skyward Thunder Lv. 4"}
Seriously? You don't even know how to use this sword?{LF}Now that's just pathetic. It couldn't possibly be easier.{LF}Even little ol' me can spin this thing around!{#Name="Cries and Whispers Lv. 1"}
A disciple at my level has more than strength, you know.{LF}He has enough bewitching beauty to make his enemies swoon.{LF}Looks like it's working on you, too! Hah!{#Name="Cries and Whispers Lv. 2"}
Money really does make the world go 'round, doesn't it?{LF}I should know, given the vast fortune I command.{LF}...Not that they let me use it yet. Lord knows why.{#Name="Cries and Whispers Lv. 3"}
Hm? Is there anything more important in life than beauty,{LF}strength, and money...? Hah! What a kidder you are!{LF}I mean, do you even need to ask?{#Name="Cries and Whispers Lv. 4"}
The tower loomed, its white stonework unmarked by a single{LF}crack or crevice. Inside, a girl lived alone. Because none of{LF}her servants spoke to her, she knew nothing of speech.{#Name="Once a Woman Lv. 1"}
Throughout her captivity, the girl's servants refused to{LF}acknowledge her existence. But local villagers knew of her,{LF}and when a great famine struck the land, they took action.{#Name="Once a Woman Lv. 2"}
The villagers killed every last servant as they climbed the{LF}tower. "Cursed wench!" they shouted. "This is your fault!"{LF}But the girl could not understand the words. {#Name="Once a Woman Lv. 3"}
The girl was overjoyed to finally be exposed to emotion,{LF}even that of rage. A smile came to her face as the sword struck{LF}home, securing her place as an offering to the village gods.{#Name="Once a Woman Lv. 4"}
The warming breath of green granted fortune to all.{LF}The shining azure flow gave blessings to all.{LF}Flowers bloomed. Life teemed. It was a land of promise.{#Name="Imperial Fang Lv. 1"}
Countless great forces waged war over the land, troubling{LF}and trampling its bounties. Soon, mountains of mangled{LF}corpses replaced the blessings of earlier, better days.{#Name="Imperial Fang Lv. 2"}
Time passed. Trees grew over the bodies, and soon the cries{LF}of war were replaced with softly babbling brooks. Only a{LF}lone sword planted in the ground spoke of the terrible past.{#Name="Imperial Fang Lv. 3"}
The young king drew the sword from the earth. "I claim this{LF}beautiful land for my own!" he said. Will the cycle begin anew?{LF}...Alas, I must save that story for another time.{#Name="Imperial Fang Lv. 4"}
Ah! You have an eye for quality, sir. This sword comes from{LF}a far-off land. Know you the tale? A young man slew a horrid{LF}beast, and grew so renowned, the king became mad with envy.{#Name="Feral King's Wildblade Lv. 1"}
The king sent him on an impossible quest, and the young man{LF}fell to the very monsters he was meant to slay. His sister{LF}pleaded for his remains, but all she received was his sword.{#Name="Feral King's Wildblade Lv. 2"}
The sister became the king's mistress, and she used the{LF}sword to murder him before turning it on herself. And now{LF}the blade is used to exact revenge on... Sir? Are you okay?{#Name="Feral King's Wildblade Lv. 3"}
What's with that sword in your hand? ...Revenge, you say?{LF}B-But I'm just a weapons merchant! My sword didn't kill{LF}your family! It's just a blade! Just a... No! Stop! Wai—{#Name="Feral King's Wildblade Lv. 4"}

In a poor nation lived two knights: one clad in ivory armor,{LF}the other in ebon black. They battled to bring fortune to the{LF}land, while occasionally sharing dreams over a skin of wine.{#Name="Spear of Empathy Lv. 1"}
But over time, they quarreled. The ebon knight began to{LF}distrust his despotic king, while the ivory knight strove to{LF}keep his oath. And soon, the friends became bitter rivals.{#Name="Spear of Empathy Lv. 2"}
One day, a cadre of knights held a coup against the cruel king,{LF}led by the ebon knight. But the ivory knight slew his companion{LF}and quelled the rebellion, earning much fame and fortune.{#Name="Spear of Empathy Lv. 3"}
The ivory knight calmed his king's despotic nature, and was{LF}given an ornate spear as a reward. But he refused, and instead{LF}insisted on using the spear that had slain his onetime friend.{#Name="Spear of Empathy Lv. 4"}
The strait was called the "Ship Graveyard" for its stormy{LF}waters. Few ships dared to cross it, and soon the nearby{LF}island found itself dangerously short of supplies. {#Name="Thunder Princess Lv. 1"}
The islanders decided to make a sacrifice to the god of{LF}the seas. As they debated who would be offered up, the{LF}daughter of the island headman gave herself as tribute.{#Name="Thunder Princess Lv. 2"}
Once the fairest woman on the island, her skin was now{LF}covered in burns. Her father tried to stop her, but she donned{LF}the ceremonial armor and threw herself into the sea.{#Name="Thunder Princess Lv. 3"}
Soon, the waves lessened and the sea was calmed. The large{LF}spear the girl carried with her stands alone on the seabed,{LF}occasionally quivering to the sounds of distant thunder.{#Name="Thunder Princess Lv. 4"}

She was a prostitute with a habit of falling in love with her{LF}customers, but they fled whenever she proposed. This puzzled{LF}her, as she was unaware her job was viewed with disdain.{#Name="Robber King Lv. 1"}
One day, an ugly old man came to her. Once their business{LF}was done, the woman asked for his hand in marriage. He began{LF}to cry, for though he was king, none had ever loved him.{#Name="Robber King Lv. 2"}
The prostitute became queen of the land. But soon after{LF}the ceremony, the king was felled by his own heart, leaving{LF}her with untold fortune and all of his political power.{#Name="Robber King Lv. 3"}
The woman had been so close to happiness, but now her{LF}beloved was gone. Thus, she took up his spear—the last{LF}memento of her husband—and fled the palace forever.{#Name="Robber King Lv. 4"}
No known magic could cure the little girl's disease. Her{LF}only joys were the nightly visits from a nameless masked{LF}conjurer who came to her with a magical staff in hand.{#Name="Conjurer's Staff Lv. 1"}
The conjurer shared his arcane talents with her. One night,{LF}a shower of glittering light. The next, an orchestra of tiny{LF}songbirds. Another, the arc of a dazzling rainbow.{#Name="Conjurer's Staff Lv. 2"}
Yet the disease slowly consumed the girl's body. One night,{LF}when her time was near, she smiled at the conjurer and {LF}thanked him. Then she grew cold and smiled no more.{#Name="Conjurer's Staff Lv. 3"}
The conjurer had been forbidden to show magic to others,{LF}but when he returned and confessed that he'd taken the staff{LF}without permission, his master told him to keep it. That night,{LF}the conjurer clutched the staff tightly and wept bitter tears.{#Name="Conjurer's Staff Lv. 4"}

The youngest prince held ambitions of the throne. But his{LF}elder brother fought a campaign of great battles and earned{LF}the people's adoration. And so, he had to be dealt with.{#Name="Seer's Lure Lv. 1"}
The youngest prince was in battle against a nearby kingdom{LF}when he looted a fine spear from a fallen soldier. Suddenly,{LF}a voice rang out, "Seek ye power?" And the prince nodded.{#Name="Seer's Lure Lv. 2"}
Many victories greeted the young prince, while his brother's{LF}fortunes soured. Soon, he sat upon the throne he desired so{LF}much. But then the voice returned: "Now I shall reclaim it."{#Name="Seer's Lure Lv. 3"}
The new king lost all. His men died in battle. His wife and{LF}son died of disease. With tears of blood streaming down{LF}his face, he cursed the world and fell upon his spear.{#Name="Seer's Lure Lv. 4"}
The fertile land was fought over time and again, spawning{LF}mountains of corpses. The young lord, who had watched the{LF}previous king die, gave an order: "Burn it to the ground."{#Name="Imperial Tears Lv. 1"}
No nobleman or peasant opposed him. The fires were set.{LF}The green trees burned. The animals scattered. And the land{LF}the previous king had sworn to save was reduced to ash.{#Name="Imperial Tears Lv. 2"}
When the flames finally died, the land was sealed and{LF}declared an eternal neutral zone. Over decades, it regained{LF}its beauty, but a single spear still resided deep within.{#Name="Imperial Tears Lv. 3"}
It was once a sword, obtained by the king who had sworn{LF}to protect the land. But it was reforged into a spear by his{LF}ruinous successor, and was now rusted beyond recognition.{LF}What became of this once promising land? None can say.{#Name="Imperial Tears Lv. 4"}
This is the story of a spear that fell into the hands of{LF}a certain man. The man did not realize that his time in{LF}this world was growing short. ...But the spear knew.{#Name="Final Knell Lv. 1"}
The man loved the sound the spear emitted, but did not know it{LF}was the weapon warning him of his impending doom. Alas, the{LF}man died in combat, his spear echoing out across the wastes.{#Name="Final Knell Lv. 2"}
This is the story of one man's end. A cold, stiff body,{LF}and next to it, a spear, quietly mourning the death of{LF}its five hundred and sixty-eighth master.{#Name="Final Knell Lv. 3"}
The spear waits for the day its cry can once again ring out.{LF}It has seen the end of countless masters across an ocean{LF}of time, and even today still waits for the next.{#Name="Final Knell Lv. 4"}

In a poor village deep in the arid mountains lived a devoted{LF}nun. Her quiet prayers soothed the hearts of the people,{LF}a lone flower blossoming in the wastelands of their minds.{#Name="Golden Petals Lv. 1"}
One day, disease struck the village. The victims shriveled{LF}into mottled invalids before dying in enormous pain. And {LF}though the nun prayed and prayed, the illness ran rampant.{#Name="Golden Petals Lv. 2"}
As she prayed, buds began to sprout from the corpses. {LF}As each villager fell, new flowers grew, and soon,{LF}the entire village was filled with their sweet aroma.{#Name="Golden Petals Lv. 3"}

The new nation spread across a bountiful landscape,{LF}but it was home to a vast, destructive war. The old retainers{LF}muttered under their breath, cursing the brash young king.{#Name="Imperial Claws Lv. 1"}
"I care not for the past," said the king. "No matter how hard,{LF}we must move on and bring fortune to the land!" And so{LF}he began a never-ending war against their neighbors.{#Name="Imperial Claws Lv. 2"}
The land's resources filled the kingdom's coffers for a{LF}time, bringing prosperity to all. But eventually the land{LF}began to run dry, and the people grew weary of war.{#Name="Imperial Claws Lv. 3"}

Let me curse. Let me wail.{LF}If you reach that place where the water god cannot see.{LF}And another voice finds you. And a new woman holds you.{#Name="Azure Arms Lv. 3"}
Let me sink. Let me wait.{LF}Until your eyes close and your breathing stops.{LF}We want you for ourselves. We want to end you all.{#Name="Azure Arms Lv. 4"}
The words of the curse dug themselves into my ears.{LF}The hate hidden in justice's shadows became a poison.{#Name="Darklord's Flame Lv. 1"}
The overwhelming light stole away my vision.{LF}Under the banner of freedom and liberty, a dark shadow is cast.{#Name="Darklord's Flame Lv. 2"}
I lost my voice in the face of never-ending despair.{LF}How could hope have been so extinguished?{#Name="Darklord's Flame Lv. 3"}
I strain to bury deprivation with my mind's new justice.{LF}The chaos of war shall burn it anew; it is only a matter of time.{#Name="Darklord's Flame Lv. 4"}
I have gladly pledged loyalty to the king across time.{LF}No matter how hellish the fight or reckless the order,{LF}I have risked all to protect king and country.{#Name="Captain's Guard Lv. 1"}
But the king has lost his life in battle. He was young,{LF}a newly crowned lord, and left behind no descendants.{LF}Who will I ever serve now?{#Name="Captain's Guard Lv. 2"}
Wailing over such things will achieve nothing.{LF}My only job is to protect my country.{LF}My only mission is to serve my king.{#Name="Captain's Guard Lv. 3"}
So I search. I search for a body to replace the long-{LF}shattered muscle and bone that resided in this armor.{LF}I search for a new king worthy of wearing me.{#Name="Captain's Guard Lv. 4"}
Sing! Sing! Sing!{LF}Let me sing, let me sing, let me sing!{LF}Of the seas, of the skies, of my hopes, of my prayers!{#Name="Deathly Briars Lv. 1"}
Spin! Spin! Spin!{LF}Let me dance, let me dance, let me dance!{LF}Happy dances, beautiful dances, sad dances, ugly dances!{#Name="Deathly Briars Lv. 2"}
Huff! Huff! Huff!{LF}Let me gasp, let me gasp, let me gasp!{LF}In the rain, in my dreams, in battle, in sheer ecstasy!{#Name="Deathly Briars Lv. 3"}
Prick! Prick! Prick!{LF}Let me stab, let me stab, let me stab!{LF}In your skin, in your eyes, in your tears, in your screams!{#Name="Deathly Briars Lv. 4"}
The land was ruled by an empress witch who used magic{LF}powers to govern her people. She was a cruel, oppressive{LF}ruler who took joy in slaughtering innocents at random.{#Name="Tyrant's Playthings Lv. 1"}
But the empress was restless. Torturing victims, drinking{LF}fine wines as they screamed... It was fun, yes, but even{LF}fun grows wearisome when repeated too often.{#Name="Tyrant's Playthings Lv. 2"}
Many would-be heroes came to the castle, united by dreams{LF}of my death. The first few were enjoyable enough, but now{LF}it's just a chore. They're all so simple-minded!{#Name="Tyrant's Playthings Lv. 3"}
If no hero is strong enough to defeat me, I'll just have to{LF}make one myself. I need a strong child. A terrifying hero.{LF}One with enough power to topple his own mother...{#Name="Tyrant's Playthings Lv. 4"}
He is a great and powerful king.{LF}{LF}Do not tell him what to do.{#Name="Darkseal Order Lv. 1"}
It is a vast and evil power.{LF}{LF}Do not attempt to unravel it.{#Name="Darkseal Order Lv. 2"}
He is a strong and fearsome foe.{LF}{LF}Do not challenge him to battle.{#Name="Darkseal Order Lv. 3"}
He is a small and tender child.{LF}{LF}Do not disturb him yet.{#Name="Darkseal Order Lv. 4"}

A journey is an enjoyable thing, especially one to learn the{LF}secrets of a woman. It's ever so exciting, which you can{LF}see for yourself if you move your eyes juuust a bit lower...{#Name="Everlasting Ring Lv. 1"}
Climbing those two mountains is so enjoyable. Feeling the{LF}soft ground beneath you, stuffing yourself with the small{LF}fruits found at the peak... Ah, that I had more mouths!{#Name="Everlasting Ring Lv. 2"}
It's wonderful to rest in the mother forest. Whether your{LF}nose follows the aroma of the underbrush, or you dare{LF}explore the dark cavern that lies below... Ah, what bliss!{#Name="Everlasting Ring Lv. 3"}
And let us not forget about a hike to the spring! A generous{LF}drink of the liquid o'erflowing from deep within my beloved{LF}pond would be enough to harden up anyone's weaponry.{#Name="Everlasting Ring Lv. 4"}
The boy ran. His blade—which seemed far too large for his{LF}small frame—cut through the garrison like warm butter.{LF}Heads rolled. Blood flew. The boy kept running.{#Name="Electroshocker Lv. 1"}
He cried to the captain, "This is for my brothers!"{LF}He made his way forward, mowing down soldiers in his wake,{LF}but the lancers took his life before he could reach his goal.{#Name="Electroshocker Lv. 2"}
Looking down from his steed, the captain ordered his men{LF}to dispose of the body. Then he rode off without a word,{LF}refusing to think of his son lying in the dirt behind him.{#Name="Electroshocker Lv. 3"}
The captain had three sons left, and the one who slew him{LF}would gain all that he owned. ...Such a ridiculous game.{LF}As he rode away, he prayed the gods would take him soon.{#Name="Electroshocker Lv. 4"}
Why does no one recognize my arcane skills? Why do they{LF}not respect me? Applaud me? Why, why, why!? I hate it!{LF}I want to beat all of them into the ground!{#Name="Ring of Lament Lv. 1"}
It's HIM! HE steals my magic! That's why I don't receive{LF}the praise I so richly deserve. It's all his fault. That's why{LF}I must kill him. I do it for justice. For the human race!{#Name="Ring of Lament Lv. 2"}
Cold steel is the perfect reply to his idle words. I am not{LF}in the wrong! With this cursed blade, I shall silence the{LF}sorcerer and prove that I am worthy! Not him! Me! ME!{#Name="Ring of Lament Lv. 3"}
Hear the laughter as I behold the bloody lump that used to{LF}be a sorcerer! Now I am the greatest magician in the world!{LF}Such a shame I fell into this well in my excitement...{#Name="Ring of Lament Lv. 4"}
The small island was surrounded on all sides by the sea.{LF}It was a quiet place, blessed by beautiful, verdant nature.{LF}And once, it was where violent criminals were sent to die.{#Name="Azure Cleaver Lv. 1"}
Atop a cliff was a grave etched with a bladed blue ring.{LF}Fresh flowers covered it every day. "Who lies here?" the{LF}young boy asked. "A criminal," responded the old man.{#Name="Azure Cleaver Lv. 2"}
"Then why the flowers?" asked the boy. "Because," said the{LF}man, "he led a revolution in an effort to improve the lives{LF}of all. Here he led a pure life, and here he finally died."{#Name="Azure Cleaver Lv. 3"}
And with that, the old man fell silent and gazed out to sea.{LF}The grave's blue ring reflected the blue of the sky, while{LF}the waves added a dark tone to the sharpened blade.{#Name="Azure Cleaver Lv. 4"}
"Don the frilly dress." "Put the fetching bows in your hair."{LF}"Slip on your finest shoes." "Use your voice." "Flash your{LF}smile." "Close in on the target." "Whisper love in his ear."{#Name="Duchess's Dance Lv. 1"}
"Pluck feathers from an extinct bird." "Make a coat from the{LF}pelts of tiny creatures." "Sprinkle your petals on the water."{LF}"Sing the minstrel's love song just as it was taught to you."{#Name="Duchess's Dance Lv. 2"}
Many men have knelt before me, their rough voices begging{LF}for my love, their lips fumbling trite poetry. Every man is the{LF}same. Every day is the same. Every gilded, tiresome day.{#Name="Duchess's Dance Lv. 3"}
Can anyone slash this routine? Can any bedecked blade{LF}cleave it in twain? I do not wish for such an end, and yet as{LF}I watch these wretches writhing in the road like maggots...{#Name="Duchess's Dance Lv. 4"}
The Tenth Blade: "Throne of the False God"{LF}May its force echo as the gods across the land.{#Name="Rule of Divine Law Lv. 1"}
The Eleventh Blade: "Knightly Darkness"{LF}May its soul be as noble and lofty as a stout knight.{#Name="Rule of Divine Law Lv. 2"}
The Twelfth Blade: "Queensthorn"{LF}May its beauty be as pure as the reigning empress.{#Name="Rule of Divine Law Lv. 3"}
The Thirteenth Blade: "Thunderous King"{LF}May its power be as eternal as our beloved ruler.{#Name="Rule of Divine Law Lv. 4"}
Once, there were two brother roosters. The elder was{LF}courageous and bore strong, sharp claws, while the{LF}younger was extremely quick-witted and intelligent.{#Name="Vidofnir's Blade Lv. 1"}
One day, the gods gathered the birds of the world and said,{LF}"I shall grant the right to rule to the bird who ascends the{LF}World Tree." And with that, the birds were off.{#Name="Vidofnir's Blade Lv. 2"}
The winged birds flew up, but were burned by the sun.{LF}The clawed birds climbed up, but were consumed by snakes.{LF}Only the roosters, working together, managed to reach the top.{#Name="Vidofnir's Blade Lv. 3"}
"Fight!" said one of the gods. "Only one of you may rule!"{LF}But the brothers leapt at the god and removed his head.{LF}And there they sit still, feasting upon his entrails atop the tree.{#Name="Vidofnir's Blade Lv. 4"}
The woman was near the end of her life. She had committed{LF}crimes and been arrested. After an extended torture session,{LF}she was sentenced to burn at the stake.{#Name="Skyward Wind Lv. 1"}
Suddenly, a white horse with sad blue eyes appeared before{LF}her. "The king took my son!" she screamed at the animal.{LF}"Before I die, I will kill him with my own two hands!"{#Name="Skyward Wind Lv. 2"}
The woman screamed at the horse until she collapsed into{LF}sobs. The next thing she knew, she was atop the horse with{LF}a sword in her hand, and the king trembling in front of her.{#Name="Skyward Wind Lv. 3"}
She slew the king and made to flee. But suddenly, her horse{LF}was gone. Her body burst into flames, which raged until she{LF}became a small pile of ashes scattered away by the wind.{#Name="Skyward Wind Lv. 4"}
Once, there was a girl and two boys who were friends.{LF}One boy went to work for a landscaper; the other became{LF}an army captain. The girl grew up to be stunningly beautiful.{#Name="Widow's Sin Lv. 1"}
One day, the girl's father died. To provide for her poor family,{LF}she decided to marry her friend, the army captain. He was{LF}scheduled to head to the front lines the day after the wedding.{#Name="Widow's Sin Lv. 2"}
The captain smiled and swore to return. It was the last time{LF}the woman saw her new husband smile. He died soon after,{LF}leaving her alone with their home and beautiful garden.{#Name="Widow's Sin Lv. 3"}
The garden changed with the seasons, giving the woman peace.{LF}Yet, until the day an illness took her at a tender age, she never{LF}knew her other childhood friend was the one tending to it.{#Name="Widow's Sin Lv. 4"}
It was a blessed land, a paradise with endless resources{LF}that guaranteed peace and prosperity for any nation.{LF}Men had fought each other over it since time immemorial.{#Name="Imperial Coffin Lv. 1"}
The king fought for the promised land at the cost of his{LF}nation's health. With disease ravaging him, he asked his{LF}son how this could truly be the promised land.{#Name="Imperial Coffin Lv. 2"}
Why were people willing to sustain bloodshed for the sake{LF}of the land? If it were truly a blessing, why had it been{LF}the source of so much senseless pain, loss, and hate?{#Name="Imperial Coffin Lv. 3"}
The old king breathed his last. As the prince sat silently by{LF}his coffin, he swore a silent oath. What story would he weave{LF}once he became king? Ah, that's a tale for another day...{#Name="Imperial Coffin Lv. 4"}
