It's her! Zero's here!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Attack! Attack!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Uh...ah... Ahhhhhhh!{#Name="Soldier G"}
The darkness is our ally, men! We know the lay of this land!{#Name="Soldier E"}
We can't let anything happen to Lady Two!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Right! We stop Zero here, no matter what!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Dammit! Are these bastards immortal!?{#Name="Soldier F"}
Get a medic over here! Mediiic!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Who are we here to protect?{#Name="Soldier A"}
Lady Two, sir!{#Name="Soldiers C/D"}
And what is our ultimate mission?{#Name="Soldier A"}
Victory, sir!{#Name="Soldiers C/D"}
Forward! Get a move on!{#Name="Soldier A"}
B-But sir, it's so c-cold...{#Name="Soldier G"}
You call yourself a soldier, rookie!?{#Name="Soldier A"}
Augh! It's colder than a brass tit out here!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Hey, you've been injured! Just sit still, okay?{#Name="Soldier E"}
Goddammit. I don't want to die in this darkness...{#Name="Soldier D"}
For Lady Twooooo!{#Name="Soldier F"}
I'm not gonna lose! I'm not gonna lose! I'm not gonna loooose! {#Name="Soldier G"}
It's nicer here at night, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
Yeah. I got sand everywhere though.{#Name="Dito"}
Hard to believe it was so hot earlier.{#Name="Zero"}
In my hair. In my cracks...{LF}Lots of sand in my cracks.{#Name="Dito"}
Enough already! How about I bury you{LF}in your precious sand, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
Lady Zero.{#Name="Decadus"}
Yeah?{#Name="Zero"}
Fighting can still dehydrate you,{LF}even at low temperatures.{#Name="Decadus"}
Please be mindful of your health at all times.{#Name="Decadus"}
Thanks for the tip.{#Name="Zero"}
That said, my mouth is kinda dry.{LF}And my head hurts...{#Name="Zero"}
Lady Zero, those are classic dehydration symptoms!{LF}You need water right away!{#Name="Decadus"}

The hell is that?{#Name="Zero"}
What the hell? Why am I so cold right now?{#Name="Zero"}
I fear it's a hostile magic attack.{#Name="Octa"}
One that saps your bodily energy.{#Name="Octa"}
I thought we were done with crap like this.{#Name="Dito"}
Let's use the enemy's fires{LF}to keep warm as we move.{#Name="Decadus"}
First it's hot as hell, and now it's cold as balls.{#Name="Zero"}
Perhaps a little game of bury the{LF}sandworm would warm you up!{#Name="Octa"}
Dear old Octa can heat your{LF}insides to the boiling point...{#Name="Octa"}
I think your brain is boiling, old man.{#Name="Zero"}
S-So cold... C-Can't talk... T-Teeth chattery...{#Name="Dito"}
You sure talk a lot for a guy{LF}who says he can't talk. {#Name="Zero"}
Indeed!{#Name="Octa"}
Yes, do please be quiet.{#Name="Decadus"}
Whatever, you fu—{#Name="Dito"}
You seem unfazed, Decadus. Aren't you cold?{#Name="Zero"}
I am, my lady. Cold and physically exhausted.{#Name="Decadus"}
Theeen why do you look so happy?{#Name="Zero"}
You know why? 'Cause he's a freak{LF}who likes having his junk—{#Name="Dito"}
Sorry, I didn't quite get that.{#Name="Zero"}
Hiding my true desires from them...{LF}Such a devious game!{#Name="Decadus"}
You know, I'm actually not cold at all.{#Name="Cent"}
This kind of cold simply isn't enough{LF}to affect a man of my caliber.{#Name="Cent"}
So why's your nose runnin'{LF}like a fountain, then, huh?{#Name="Dito"}
Oh ho! I wager these sorcerers{LF}are the source of our cold snap!{#Name="Octa"}
Then let's go tear 'em a new one!{#Name="Zero"}
然り{#Name="オクタ"}
ゼロ、殺っちゃえ！　殺っちゃえ！{#Name="ディト"}
ああ。さっさと済まそう{#Name="ゼロ"}
Finally down...{#Name="Zero"}
That should take care of this cold spell.{#Name="Octa"}
Ugh! I'm getting sick of this!{#Name="Zero"}
I surmise that spirits have taken{LF}control of these undead soldiers.{#Name="Octa"}
There must be necromancers nearby.{#Name="Octa"}
This gets more annoying by the minute.{#Name="Zero"}
This gets more annoying by the minute.{#Name="Zero"}
What are you standing around for!? Kill 'em!{#Name="Zero"}
All these temperature fluxes{LF}are messin' with my health...{#Name="Dito"}
I'LL mess with your health if you don't get moving!{#Name="Zero"}
I'm fighting! I'm totally fighting! Watch me go!{#Name="Dito"}
What's all the fuss about, Octa?{#Name="Zero"}
Hmm? I don't know of any fuss?{#Name="Octa"}
Oh, you don't, do you?{#Name="Zero"}
Then what's with the sudden{LF}broom handle in your pants?{#Name="Zero"}
Oh ho! You discovered my secret, did you!?{#Name="Octa"}
I was just engaging in some{LF}dirty thoughts while fighting.{#Name="Octa"}
Well, knock it off and concentrate already!{#Name="Zero"}
Forced to fight even after death.{LF}Such a horrid fate.{#Name="Decadus"}
Really? I'd think you'd be into that sort of thing.{#Name="Dito"}
Think about it! Zero could keep kicking and{LF}punching and slicing you even AFTER you die!{#Name="Dito"}
Even...after I die? Unnngh...{#Name="Decadus"}
You know, I could take these foes down{LF}with a single thumb. A single thumb!{#Name="Cent"}
Buuut I won't. That would just spoil the fun. {#Name="Cent"}
If you can do it, then do it already!{#Name="Zero"}
Nngh...rrgh...{#Name="Mikhail"}
What's wrong? You cold?{#Name="Zero"}
I...I don't know.{#Name="Mikhail"}
He does not seem to be in the best of health.{#Name="Decadus"}
Why's everybody worried about that big crybaby?{#Name="Dito"}
I'm a hell of a lot worse off than him right now!{#Name="Dito"}
It's purely a matter of character, I'd say.{#Name="Octa"}
Indeed. Mikhail has a charming{LF}innocence about him. You...do not.{#Name="Decadus"}
Oh, for hell's sake! He can't{LF}even tell if he's cold or not!{#Name="Dito"}
That dumb lizard's gonna be just fine.{#Name="Dito"}
How many times do we have to go through this!?{#Name="Zero"}
Over and OVER again... I'm sick of it!{#Name="Zero"}
Zero? Hey, Zero! I think I feel cold, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Really? I'm surprised you feel anything{LF}through that thick head of yours.{#Name="Zero"}
Trivia time! Did you know ice baths{LF}actually warm you up if—{#Name="Cent"}
Shut up, Cent.{#Name="Dito"}
Why don't we retreat for a bit so we can recover?{#Name="Octa"}
I'm not sure...we can...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Ooof. It does seem this area is{LF}enclosed by magical power...{#Name="Octa"}
That must be what's holding in the cold.{#Name="Decadus"}
Goddammit. I'll kill every{LF}last sorcerer around here!{#Name="Zero"}
Zero...{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's all right. This won't take long.{#Name="Zero"}
くっ……くくく。{#Name="ゼロ"}
We're gonna kill every asshole{LF}who played a part in this.{#Name="Zero"}
Sorcerers... Soldiers... Intoners... Everyone.{#Name="Zero"}
If they run, they die.{LF}If they surrender, they still die!{#Name="Zero"}
We're gonna paint the walls with their blood!{#Name="Zero"}

I've had enough of you jackasses{LF}and your stupid magic circles!{#Name="Zero"}

GYAAAAAAAAAH!{#Name="Zero"}
Good heavens! What an oafish{LF}display of aggression!{#Name="Cent"}
My lady, perhaps we could let the fleeing{LF}enemies go? They are no danger to us.{#Name="Decadus"}
No can do.{#Name="Zero"}

I don't think they're responsible{LF}for the SAND, actually...{#Name="Dito"}

Divergence: Branch C{#Name="Accord"}
April the 13th, 1000 A.D.{#Name="Accord"}
I've observed an extremely worrisome branch.{#Name="Accord"}
When the singularity known as Two captured the dragon Mikhail,{#Name="Accord"}
I detected her imposing some kind of magical influence upon him.{#Name="Accord"}
Until now, only Zero could enact such influence.{LF}This is the first known exception,{#Name="Accord"}
and as such, increases the likelihood{LF}of an unforeseen accident occurring.{#Name="Accord"}
This matter must be prioritized for careful observation.{#Name="Accord"}
