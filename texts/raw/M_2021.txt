Dammit! Don't let up! Load the next volley!{#Name="Soldier A"}
M-My hands are shaking... Someone fill in for me!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Help... Help me, Mother...{#Name="Soldier G"}
Zero's approaching! All men, draw your swords!{#Name="Soldier A"}
How can we possibly stand against an Intoner?{#Name="Soldier E"}
You can ponder it all you like when she's dead!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Chaaarge!{#Name="Soldier C"}
We're all gonna die...{#Name="Soldier D"}
Aaaugh! The flower! Get it away from me! Aaaargh!{#Name="Soldier G"}
He's gone mad...{#Name="Soldier F"}
They're still hitting us! Fire back!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Ngh! So strong! And fast!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Did you see Zero's eye?{#Name="Soldier F"}
Did I? How could I miss it?{#Name="Soldier A"}
That's no Intoner. That's a monster!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Go on! Fire! Fire NOW!{#Name="Soldier B"}
We'd just be wasting ammo!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Shut up, coward! We won't know until we try!{#Name="Soldier B"}
I don't need someone who just pissed his pants in fear calling me a coward!{#Name="Soldier E"}
At this rate, Lady Four's great nation will be smashed to rubble!{#Name="Soldier C"}
You damn idiot! Open your eyes! Don't give up!{#Name="Soldier B"}
No, YOU open your eyes! We're all gonna die here!{#Name="Soldier D"}
あんたこそ目覚まして、現実見ろよ{#Name="兵士D"}
The blood flows this day...{#Name="Soldier G"}
And on Lady Four's land, no less. Damn them!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Are we striking our targets?{#Name="Soldier A"}
Checking now!{#Name="Soldier G"}
If it be for Lady Four,{#Name="Soldier B"}
I'll gladly surrender my own life!{#Name="Soldier B"}
She's going to run right over us!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Don't worry. Our Lady still has Decadus with her.{#Name="Soldier F"}
Decadus... They say that guy can withstand any pain, no matter how grueling!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Dragon. What say you go burn some shit?{#Name="Zero"}
Huh? But...they'll all catch on fire.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Thaaat's the idea.{#Name="Zero"}
Gyaaaaaa! Fire! I'm on fiiiire!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Yaaah! It's attacking us!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Put it out! Put it oooooout!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Ah ha ha! You hear that?{#Name="Dito"}
Listen to 'em! Those poor fools are burning up!{#Name="Dito"}
The smells, the screams...{LF}Man, I'm gonna sleep great tonight!{#Name="Dito"}
You're pretty fucked up, aren't you?{#Name="Zero"}
Heh... You really know how to compliment a fella.{#Name="Dito"}
It's Zero!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Kill the accursed Intoner!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Heh. Someone's an eager beaver.{#Name="Zero"}
Hey, dummy. Why don't you go show 'em who's boss?{#Name="Zero"}
M-Me? I dunno, I don't like being all mean to—{#Name="Mikhail"}
Shut up and take out those cannons!{#Name="Zero"}
I'll handle these shits on the ground.{#Name="Zero"}
Nnngh... All right! I got it! I got it!{#Name="Mikhail"}
And stop repeating yourself!{#Name="Zero"}
Um, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
That cannon over there won't stop shooting at me.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I can't get close like this.{#Name="Mikhail"}
God, you're worthless.{#Name="Zero"}
There. No more cannon.{#Name="Zero"}
Aw, thanks, Zero...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Sorry? What was that?{#Name="Zero"}
Um...thank you?{#Name="Mikhail"}
"Thank you very much!"{#Name="Zero"}
Thank you very much!{#Name="Mikhail"}
...Better.{#Name="Zero"}
The cannon's still shooting!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Relax, would you? I'm in the middle of something!{#Name="Zero"}
It's Zero! She's here!{#Name="Soldier G"}
The demon's quest ends here!{#Name="Soldier B"}
She killed our brothers...{LF}Make her pay!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Ha! Like a bunch of dumb orcs are gonna stop me.{#Name="451"}
They ain't as big as ogres, but they're still a pain.{#Name="451"}
Be careful, Zero. These are rough circumcisions!{#Name="Mikhail"}
CircumSTANCES!{LF}...And where'd you learn that word, anyway!?{#Name="Dito"}
Well, I was close, right? Mostly close!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Shut up and help me kill these bastards,{LF}would you!?{#Name="Zero"}
気をつけて！オークがいるよ！{#Name="253"}
見れば判るって{#Name="127"}
オークは棍棒を持っているよ！！{#Name="271"}
見れば判るって{#Name="127"}
っていうかブツブツ喋ってるヒマがあるなら{LF}もう少し的確な援護しろよ{#Name="595"}
だってゼロがチョロチョロと動いて狙いづらいよ！{#Name="415"}
人のせいにする人は、先生嫌いです{#Name="289"}
They just keep dribbling out,{LF}like an old man's piss...{#Name="Zero"}
Nnngh... They're too strong...{#Name="Soldier E"}
Hold your ground! We must protect Lady Four!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Oh, God... We're gonna die!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Ha ha! Look at 'em run!{LF}That's right—flee, suckers!{#Name="Dito"}
What's so funny, Dito?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Just enjoying the freak show, watching{LF}all these ugly fools dying left and right!{#Name="Dito"}
I feel bad for them...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Really? Why?{#Name="Dito"}
Look. People that ugly don't deserve to live.{#Name="Dito"}
I gotta say, though, the smell of{LF}burning flesh never gets old!{#Name="Dito"}
This...this is an Intoner's power?{#Name="Soldier F"}
It's too much to even comprehend!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Hey! The gate just opened!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Good. Let's move.{#Name="Zero"}
Ha! It's about time they threw out{LF}something that can put up a real fight!{#Name="Zero"}
Zero! Are you okay!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
What if I'm not?{#Name="Zero"}
If you're not okay, then run! Run away!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Run away and do what?{#Name="Zero"}
Um...run away and live happily{LF}ever after somewhere else?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Remember, Zero. You can't confuse{LF}recklessness with bravery!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Oh, for the love of...{LF}Who taught you that happy horseshit?{#Name="Zero"}
Hee hee! I know! Pretty great, huh? {#Name="Mikhail"}
Shut up, idiot! It wasn't a compliment!{#Name="Zero"}
どこでそんな洒落た言葉を覚えてくるんだ……イラッとするなぁ{#Name="ゼロ"}
えへへ、褒められちゃった{#Name="ミハイル"}
褒めてねーよ！このクソドラゴン！忙しいんだから黙ってろ！{#Name="ゼロ"}
Right. Time to go take down Four.{#Name="Zero"}
Shit. This barricade's in the way.{#Name="Zero"}
Ooh! Let me help! Let me help, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
あのくらいのバリケードなら壊せると思うよ！{#Name="379"}
Go for it.{#Name="Zero"}
わかった！{#Name="91"}
If you're stuck, maybe I can help!{#Name="Mikhail"}
You DUMBASS!{#Name="Zero"}
Aaah! Zerooo!{#Name="Mikhail"}
OWWWWW!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Ow! Ow! Ow! Zero! You stabbed me! It's stuck in me, Zero!{LF}Get it out! Get it oooooout!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Sit still, dammit, or I'm gonna—{#Name="Zero"}
Faaaaaall!{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
You're mean, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Mean!? You're a fucking idiot!{#Name="Zero"}
C'mon. Four's waiting.{#Name="Zero"}
Fine...{#Name="Mikhail"}
That was some rough sailing right there.{#Name="Dito"}
Dito? What are you doing here?{#Name="Zero"}
How come you didn't get caught in the collapse?{#Name="Zero"}
Well, I figured your pal there wasn't smart{LF}enough to blow up just the barricade.{#Name="Dito"}
So I hung back to see what would happen.{LF}...I mean, duh?{#Name="Dito"}
Don't "duh" me, asshole!{#Name="Zero"}
Heh. You know, Z, your lack of{LF}common sense is kinda cute.{#Name="Dito"}
You wanna die?{#Name="Zero"}
That must be Four's citadel there.{#Name="Zero"}
Um, Zero? I don't think we can go in the normal way.{#Name="Mikhail"}
What do you mean?{#Name="Zero"}
Her song's putting up some kind of invisible barrier!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hmph. Thinks she's so goddamn clever, does she?{#Name="Zero"}
We'll make our way through here.{LF}You fly up and find another route.{#Name="Zero"}
You heard her. Make us proud, dragon!{#Name="Dito"}
I will! I promise!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
What?{#Name="Zero"}
What kind of sister is Four?{#Name="Mikhail"}
The sleazy kind.{#Name="Zero"}
Sleazy? You mean she's slutty, like Five?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Not quite like that, no.{#Name="Zero"}
She acts all sugary sweet on the surface.{LF}But deep down, she's evil.{#Name="Zero"}
I mean, you kinda have to be evil{LF}to be a virgin Intoner.{#Name="Zero"}
Huh? What's a virgin?{#Name="Mikhail"}
...Never mind that.{#Name="Zero"}
So you reeeally can't get along with her?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Really. I can't deal with virgins.{#Name="Zero"}
You can't deal with...virgins?{#Name="Mikhail"}
No, I can't. Now drop it!{#Name="Zero"}
It's Zero! She's here!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Curse the traitorous Intoner{LF}that turns against the Church!{#Name="Soldier F"}
It's all or nothing, now! Kill the Intoner!{#Name="Soldier A"}
死ぬ気で行けっ！ウタウタイを殺せ！{#Name="兵士A"}
You must really want to die, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
Well, far be it from me to let you down!{#Name="Zero"}
Are you all right? There's a lot{LF}of enemies down there!{#Name="Mikhail"}
No worries. They die pretty quick.{#Name="Zero"}
...Why do you like killing people so much?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Who said I like it?{#Name="Zero"}
Huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
If people get in my way, I kill 'em.{#Name="Zero"}
I don't get any particular joy from it.{#Name="Zero"}
Frankly, it's a pain in the ass.{#Name="Zero"}
But, if they're only in the way,{LF}can't you just talk it over?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Talking's even MORE of a pain in the ass.{#Name="Zero"}
I'd rather just kill 'em and get it over with.{#Name="Zero"}
Urgh! Why does it have to be like this!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Look, it's a grown-up thing, all right?{#Name="Zero"}
Ugh, there's more? This never ends...{#Name="Zero"}
My shoulders are killing me.{#Name="Zero"}
I'll give you a massage tonight.{LF}Just kill 'em all!{#Name="Dito"}
What's the matter!?{#Name="Zero"}
The wall! It's hard! And thick!{LF}Like, really hard and thick!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Just make it happen!{#Name="Zero"}
ゼロ！ゼロっ！もうダメだ！この壁、無理だよ！{#Name="ミハイル"}
がんばれ！なせばなる！{#Name="ゼロ"}
そうそう。デカイ図体はこのためにあるんだろ{#Name="ディト"}
もう！勝手なことばっかり言って～！！{#Name="ミハイル"}
I made it, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Argh! Be careful firing in here, you idiot!{#Name="Zero"}
It's hot as hell now!{#Name="Zero"}
****! Watch it, you limp-**** piece of **** lizard!{#Name="Dito"}
Just hold on a second!{#Name="Mikhail"}
The 1st and 2nd cannon squads are gone.{LF}If we don't stop them here...we're finished.{#Name="Soldier E"}
We face an insane Intoner! Hold nothing back!{#Name="Soldier B"}
What if she breaks through?{#Name="Soldier C"}
If she breaks through, it's all over!{#Name="Soldier D"}
What happened to the messenger{LF}we sent to Lady Four?{#Name="Soldier E"}
The messenger hasn't returned!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Damnation... Our ranks are falling apart!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Everyone's in a panic, huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
The perfect time to strike...{#Name="Zero"}
Ha ha ha! Man, this is the best.{LF}I love kicking a guy when he's down!{#Name="Dito"}
そんなつもりで言ったんじゃないよ！そんなつもりで言ったんじゃないよ！{#Name="ミハイル"}
二回言うなって言っただろ！{#Name="ゼロ"}
はーい……{#Name="ミハイル"}
I would assume that's Four's hideout...{#Name="Zero"}
Damn. Look at the size of that place...{LF}Your sis must be real scared of dyin'.{#Name="Dito"}
Dammit, dragon! Watch where you{LF}fire that shit, would you!?{#Name="Dito"}
あのクソ邪魔なバリケードを壊せ！{#Name="ゼロ"}
こっちの跳ね橋を頼む。{#Name="ゼロ"}
The enemy's counterattack grew increasingly desperate.{#Name="Accord"}
And the shrine where Four was said to be hiding out{#Name="Accord"}
was itself hidden within a massive defensive facility...{#Name="Accord"}
Watch out! It's an ogre!{#Name="Mikhail"}
This guy's dumber than a sack of hammers.{#Name="Zero"}
Yeah, dumber than hammers!{#Name="Mikhail"}
...But smarter than you.{#Name="Zero"}
Yeah, smarter than—{LF}Hey, that's mean!{#Name="Mikhail"}
