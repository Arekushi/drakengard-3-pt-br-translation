Proceed to the next mission?{#Name="ミハイル"}
みんなで話すデモ{#Name="ミハイル"}
Now, you two. Can I have a moment?{#Name="Zero"}
Yes.{#Name="Decadus/Octa"}
Good. Because you both need to hear this.{#Name="Zero"}
...Yes?{#Name="Decadus/Octa"}
I'm not going to mince words here.{#Name="Zero"}
It's about our...nighttime activities.{#Name="Zero"}
Your performance has been abysmal.{#Name="Zero"}
Preposterous!{#Name="Octa"}
My gargantuan joy-stick is the talk of the town in taverns the world—{#Name="Octa"}
Size doesn't equate to "joy" in this case.{#Name="Zero"}
Huh?{#Name="Octa"}
Look. It's not about how many times you continue...{#Name="Zero"}
It's about making the most of your play session.{#Name="Zero"}
Just being "gargantuan" is worthless.{#Name="Zero"}
So either level up your skills, or we're done. Got it?{#Name="Zero"}
Y-Yes, my lady! Terribly sorry, my lady!{#Name="Octa"}
As for you, Decadus. Frankly, you've always been{LF}a perfect gentleman to me.{#Name="Zero"}
I seek only to serve you in all things, my lady.{#Name="Decadus"}
But your...preferences are a bit...extreme.{#Name="Zero"}
We can't go five minutes without you begging me{LF}to punish you somehow.{#Name="Zero"}
Uuunnngh...{#Name="Decadus"}
That kind of stuff is fine on occasion, but if we{LF}do it every single time, it loses its impact.{#Name="Zero"}
A thousand apologies, my lady.{#Name="Decadus"}
Great, then. I'm glad we had this talk.{LF}Class dismissed.{#Name="Zero"}
Yes, my lady!{#Name="Decadus/Octa"}
By the way, Octa. Do you ever consider just...{LF}you know. Satisfying yourself?{#Name="Zero"}
Oh ho! And why would I do that when I have{LF}the whole world as my lover?{#Name="Octa"}
The whole... Wait, what?{#Name="Zero"}
Well, an Intoner is best, of course.{LF}But if one's not available, a human will suffice.{#Name="Octa"}
If neither of those are available, ****** will do. ***** are all right,{LF}too—in fact, I've been really enjoying ******* lately!{#Name="Octa"}
That's just wonderful.{#Name="Zero"}
You know, what I'd really like to try sometime? A ******!{#Name="Octa"}
Do you guys ever sleep? I always hear the three of you{LF}yelling and making weird noises at night...{#Name="Mikhail"}
We're just playing around before we go to bed.{#Name="Zero"}
You're playing? Aw, no fair! I wanna play too!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Um...yeah, no. That's not going to work.{#Name="Zero"}
Can I play when I grow up? Huh? Pleeease!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
We'll talk about it later.{#Name="Zero"}
Boy, I sure hope I grow up soon.{LF}I can't wait to play with you guys all night!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Having trouble sleeping, my lady?{#Name="Decadus"}
Not tired, I guess.{#Name="Zero"}
I imagine not. Only a madman could sleep{LF}in a world such as this.{#Name="Decadus"}
Still, please try to sleep. You need your rest.{#Name="Decadus"}
What are you, my mother?{#Name="Zero"}
No. I am your disciple.{#Name="Decadus"}
I swore to serve you for eternity.{LF}I swore to give my life in your name if needs be.{#Name="Decadus"}
All right, all right. If I need something, I'll let you know.{#Name="Zero"}
I eagerly await your orders.{#Name="Decadus"}
I suppose Lady Three was never in the forest after all.{#Name="Decadus"}
Ho ho! The Land of Sands, then?{LF}Or perhaps the Cathedral City?{#Name="Octa"}
Better tackle them both.{LF}One and Three have to be hiding somewhere.{#Name="Zero"}
You fly up and search from above.{LF}The three of us'll check the underground ruins.{#Name="Zero"}
Okay!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Very well, my lady.{#Name="Octa"}
Understood.{#Name="Decadus"}
......{#Name="Zero"}
............{#Name="Zero"}
My lady?{#Name="Octa"}
This feels...off, somehow.{#Name="Zero"}
Perhaps because Dito isn't here to complain about the plan...{#Name="Octa"}
And Cent's not making up facts that couldn't possibly be true.{#Name="Octa"}
Yeah, I suppose you're right.{#Name="Zero"}
Hmm...{#Name="Zero"}
Oh ho! So it seems disciples were always meant{LF}to be paired with certain Intoners...?{#Name="Octa"}
Yep.{#Name="Zero"}
Well, this explains a lot.{#Name="Octa"}
So Dito and Cent reverted to their original forms{#Name="Octa"}
as payment for summoning angels without their Intoners' power...{#Name="Octa"}
It takes a lot of energy to summon an angel.{LF}Without the power of a song,{#Name="Zero"}
there was no way for them to keep their human forms.{#Name="Zero"}
Ho ho ho... Well, this certainly mucks up the works, now, doesn't it?{#Name="Octa"}
And on top of that, it looks like Mikhail{LF}is having trouble restraining his appetite.{#Name="Octa"}
You could say that.{#Name="Zero"}
What did that Accord girl say again?{#Name="Octa"}
It's a dragon's instinct to consume the flower?{#Name="Octa"}
I don't think he can hold something like that in check so easily...{#Name="Octa"}
Hmmm...{#Name="Octa"}
When the time comes, I'll feed him.{#Name="Zero"}
He can have me.{#Name="Zero"}
By the way, Octa...{#Name="Zero"}
Yes?{#Name="Octa"}
Isn't it about time you had a bath?{#Name="Zero"}
But I thought you enjoyed my musky odor!{#Name="Octa"}
Besides, the sweet tang of man-funk really gets me in the mood...{#Name="Octa"}
Wash up or get out.{#Name="Zero"}
Goodness, this is quite the dilemma indeed...{#Name="Octa"}
...Really?{#Name="Zero"}
If neither of those are available, plants will do. Trees are all right,{LF}too—in fact, I've been really enjoying mangoes lately!{#Name="Octa"}
You know, what I'd really like to try sometime? A durian!{#Name="Octa"}
こんなクソみたいな砂漠で迷うとは……{#Name="ゼロ"}
We are Recorders.{#Name="Accord"}
Our duty is to observe.{#Name="Accord"}
But as I continued to record the singularity known as Zero,{#Name="Accord"}
I began to find myself filled with very strange emotions...{#Name="Accord"}
