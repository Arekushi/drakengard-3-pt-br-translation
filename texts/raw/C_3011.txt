Seems like this room is locked.{#Name="Zero"}
There's a map over here.{#Name="Dito"}
Guess we need a key, huh?{#Name="Dito"}

We can't get down below without a key.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm sure one'll turn up eventually.{#Name="Dito"}
You think there are any corpses hidden on this airship?{#Name="Dito"}
Probably would've been here for a while, which means{LF}they'd be all decayed and falling apart.{#Name="Dito"}
