It's been a long time, Zero.{#Name="One"}
Has it? I didn't notice.{#Name="Zero"}
You haven't changed a bit. You're still insane.{#Name="One"}
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.{#Name="Zero"}
That wasn't a compliment.{#Name="One"}
Hey, it's Zero! Hey, Zeeerooo!{#Name="Two"}
{06}>{#Name="Three"}
Zero, this fighting is pointless!{LF}You have to stop! We're sisters!{#Name="Four"}
Oh, don't be such a prude, Four.{LF}A good catfight really gets my juices flowing...{#Name="Five"}
 {#Name="ファイブ"}
Wow, I sure am popular around here...{#Name="Zero"}
Enough talk, Zero.{#Name="One"}
This is the end.{#Name="One"}
Hey, Zero, guess what?{LF}Next month, I'm goin' on a trip!{#Name="Two"}
So actually? I really don't have{LF}time for this right now!{#Name="Two"}
I wouldn't bother packing for{LF}your trip, Two.{#Name="Zero"}
Huh? Why not?{LF}Are you gonna pack for me!?{#Name="Two"}
No, I'm gonna kill you!{#Name="Zero"}
A caged bird cannot be free,{LF}even if it flees the cage.{#Name="Three"}
A bird without freedom has{LF}no place in the skies.{#Name="Three"}
You never did make any damn{LF}sense, Three.{#Name="Zero"}
Perhaps restraint is a source{LF}of happiness unto itself.{#Name="Three"}
Would you just shut up and{LF}die already?{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Three"}
Please, Sister!{LF}Reconsider your actions!{#Name="Four"}
The real Zero would never do{LF}anything like this!{#Name="Four"}
We're family! Whatever's troubling{LF}you, I'll help however I can! {#Name="Four"}
You'll help, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
Well, I suppose there is ONE{LF}thing you can do for me...{#Name="Zero"}
You can curl up and DIE!{#Name="Zero"}
Are you really about to get ravaged{LF}by your own sisters, Zero?{#Name="Five"}
Whatever. Stop leering at me.{#Name="Zero"}
I just love a sore loser...{#Name="Five"}
Ugh. I get the worst headaches{LF}listening to you.{#Name="Zero"}
You poor thing. I'd love to let you rest{LF}your head on my magnificent bosom...{#Name="Five"}
But it seems like we're destined{LF}to fight instead.{#Name="Five"}
Fate can be such a cruel mistress...{#Name="Five"}
What do you want from us, Zero?{#Name="One"}
What do you think?{#Name="Zero"}
There's only enough room in this{LF}world for one Intoner.{#Name="Zero"}
And you'd kill your own sisters{LF}for that right?{#Name="One"}
That's kind of what I'm doing, yeah.{#Name="Zero"}
...Traitor.{#Name="One"}
Gabriel!{#Name="One"}
Heh. Well, look who decided to summon a daemon.{#Name="Zero"}
That's no longer a dragon you've got there, One.{#Name="Zero"}
It's just a monster!{#Name="Zero"}
Shut up! I'm not subject to your judgment, Sister!{#Name="One"}
We Intoners swore to keep the world in balance.{#Name="One"}
And now you seek all our power for yourself?{LF}It's shameful!{#Name="One"}
Yak yak yak yak. Shut up and DIE ALREADY!{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
Finish her.{#Name="One"}
Y-You...{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
will DIE!{#Name="Zero"}
Zero!{#Name="Michael"}
Fiiiiiire!{#Name="Zero"}
One!{#Name="Four"}
How can he still have so much strength...{#Name="One"}
{06}>{#Name="Michael"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
She fled.{#Name="One"}
You truly thought to kill the Intoners?{#Name="One"}
Silly girl.{#Name="One"}
{06}>{#Name="One"}
Now... Let us sing of the world's end.{#Name="One"}
Kill your sisters.{#Name="説明文"}
Oh, it's the end all right...{#Name="Zero"}
Defeat Gabriel!{#Name="説明文"}
