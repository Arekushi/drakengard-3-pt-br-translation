Fear not, for you do not fight alone.{#Name="Michael"}
Your dragon's protection must be a welcome thing indeed.{LF}You should thank him.{#Name="Michael"}
I'm...dreaming again...{#Name="Zero"}
Not every dragon is like you, Michael.{LF}...Unfortunately.{#Name="Zero"}

The mountain breeze feels good, doesn't it?{#Name="Dito"}
Beats all that sticky saltwater air clinging to your skin.{#Name="Dito"}
...Or the sticky, sweaty touch of Lady Five.{LF}God, I think I'm gonna gag.{#Name="Dito"}
Hey, you shouldn't talk like that.{LF}You're her disciple!{#Name="Mikhail"}
A disciple's supposed to be nice to his Intoner!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Heh. Like I give a good goddamn.{#Name="Dito"}
Ol' Blubber Bags went and kicked the bucket, remember?{LF}She doesn't mean squat to me anymore.{#Name="Dito"}
You saw it yourself, didn't you?{#Name="Dito"}
The way my blade split those ridiculous funbags{LF}clean in two? It was like fine art!{#Name="Dito"}
消去{#Name=" "}
消去{#Name=" "}
消去{#Name=" "}
What a way to go, huh? I should've been a butcher.{LF}Ha ha ha ha ha!{#Name="Dito"}
Hey, Zero? Do we really have to go kill Four?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Not this again.{#Name="Zero"}
It's just... I felt really bad for Five, you know?{#Name="Mikhail"}
She was crying. She was crying a lot,{LF}and you killed her anyway.{#Name="Mikhail"}
You know that was just an act, right?{#Name="Zero"}
Yeah, trust me—if there's one thing Five was good at,{LF}it was faking.{#Name="Dito"}
Well, I don't like it. I still think you should stop killing your sisters!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Uh-huh.{#Name="Zero"}
Family is family. You're supposed to get along.{#Name="Mikhail"}
There's nothing worse than sisters fighting each other.{#Name="Mikhail"}
All right, let's pretend for a second.{LF}Imagine there's a big pile of raw meat here, okay?{#Name="Zero"}
Oooh! Yummy!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Now, if you divided that meat among all the dragons{LF}in the world, you'd only get a little bit.{#Name="Zero"}
That's right! Just one teeeny tiny bite.{#Name="Mikhail"}
But you'd rather have it all to yourself, right?{#Name="Zero"}
Well, yeah! I'd want the whole big pile!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Well, I want to kill my sisters so I can have the world to myself.{LF}...Make sense?{#Name="Zero"}
Um... No, I don't get it.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Never mind.{#Name="Zero"}
Come on, let's go. I've got a sister to murder.{#Name="Zero"}
Okaaay...{#Name="Mikhail"}
After defeating Five in the Land of Seas,{#Name="Accord"}
Zero took Dito, her sister's disciple, and made for her next destination.{#Name="Accord"}
The Land of Mountains...{#Name="Accord"}
Home to an impenetrable alpine citadel{#Name="Accord"}
governed by the chaste Intoner known as Four.{#Name="Accord"}
