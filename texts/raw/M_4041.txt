Friends! Welcome!{#Name="Cent"}
......{#Name="Zero"}
Two.{#Name="Zero"}
......{#Name="Two"}
Lady Two is a tad exhausted at the moment.{#Name="Cent"}
I, uh... Heh heh heh. Well, what can I say?{#Name="Cent"}
I guess my physical gifts speak for themselves.{#Name="Cent"}
You know, I actually try to make sure she enjoys our little liaisons just as—{#Name="Cent"}
TWO!{#Name="Zero"}
Lady Two is lost in her dreams right now.{#Name="Cent"}
Perhaps you could try not to interrupt.{#Name="Cent"}
...Her mind's gone, isn't it.{#Name="Zero"}
She wasn't fully developed.{#Name="Zero"}
Her body couldn't handle the power of her song.{#Name="Zero"}
Hand her over. I'll end her suffering.{#Name="Zero"}
Yeeeah, I'm afraid I can't do that.{#Name="Cent"}
Do you have any idea what you're doing?{#Name="Zero"}
Well, of course I don't! Duh!{#Name="Cent"}
I mean, look—I'm just some idiot old disciple, after all.{#Name="Cent"}
It's pretty simple, really. All I do is put{LF}my nose to the grindstone and follow orders.{#Name="Cent"}
Speaking of which, she kind of ordered me to kill you, sooo...{#Name="Cent"}
You really are an idiot.{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
All right, my lady. Open up and say "aaaaaah..."{#Name="Cent"}
Aaaaaahh...{#Name="Two"}
Yes! Perfect! Just like that—keep it up!{#Name="Cent"}
Behold the second song:{#Name="Cent"}
Great Fist of Antiquity!{#Name="Cent"}
The blood-wind storms that slash through fate...{#Name="Cent"}
The steely hand that has sworn allegiance...{#Name="Cent"}
Cross the countless swarms of writhing dead!{#Name="Cent"}
I, Cent, summon thee in my name...{#Name="Cent"}
Egregori, dance!{#Name="Cent"}
91{#Name="91"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
Mich...ael...{#Name="Two"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
You...You evolved...again.{#Name="Zero"}
......{#Name="Zero"}
Huh. I guess that's that.{#Name="Cent"}
Welp! A clever and handsome man like me knows when he's beaten.{#Name="Cent"}
I suppose from this point on...I'll be serving you, Lady Zero.{#Name="Cent"}
You're not gonna follow Two to the grave?{#Name="Zero"}
Heavens, no!{#Name="Cent"}
I just want to serve an Intoner. I really don't care which one.{#Name="Cent"}
After all...I'm just a big idiot, right?{#Name="Cent"}
Enemy sighted! All men, take position!{#Name="Soldier A"}
We must keep our beloved Lady Two safe!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Don't retreat! Never retreat!{#Name="Soldier F"}
It's Zero, the black swan of falsehoods!{#Name="Soldier C"}
She'll rue the day she challenged Lady Two!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Nooo! I'm scared! Get me off the front line!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Hang in there! If we die, we die together!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Hold your ground! We're Lady Two's last vanguard!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Yeah! It's time to show her our invincible iron fist!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Goddammit. He had to go and summon{LF}these gourd-head things.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh? But Lady Two thinks they're much{LF}more useful than plain old gourds.{#Name="Cent"}
Oh—trivia time! Do you know why some{LF}gourds are narrow in the middle?{#Name="Cent"}
So they can rearrange their nutrients{LF}halfway down the fruit!{#Name="Cent"}
It's SCIENCE! Wah-chaaa!{#Name="Cent"}
Stop pretending you know what{LF}you're talking about, idiot!{#Name="Zero"}
Idiot? Mmm, yeah. Rude.{#Name="Cent"}
Now, I'm a kind-hearted man, so I'm{LF}usually willing to forgive such insults...{#Name="Cent"}
But that was really uncalled for.{LF}Wasn't it, Lady Two?{#Name="Cent"}
An idiot's an idiot.{#Name="Zero"}
And Two lost her soul because she{LF}believed all the idiot crap you spouted.{#Name="Zero"}
That makes her the biggest idiot of all. {#Name="Zero"}
ENOUGH! You will STOP belittling{LF}my lady at ONCE!{#Name="Cent"}
Fighting two of these at once is rough.{#Name="Zero"}
Maybe we can all be friends instead!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Doubt it.{#Name="Zero"}
トウ様、おいたわしや……。あの様子では、まぐわいを楽しむどころではありませんな{#Name="オクタ"}
かもね！{#Name="ゼロ"}
ここは一つ、私めが新たな境地を切り拓いて見せましょうぞ{#Name="オクタ"}
トウとヤるのは勝手だが、ヤる前にこいつらを倒していけよ{#Name="ゼロ"}
あとちょっとですね、ゼロ！{#Name="ディト"}
ああ。一気にいくぞ！！{#Name="ゼロ"}
Good! CRUSH IT!{#Name="Zero"}
ゼロ様、お見事！{#Name="オクタ"}
お世辞を言ってるヒマがあったら、{LF}一体でも多く倒せ！{#Name="ゼロ"}
It sure is dark in here, huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yep.{#Name="Zero"}
If you're scared, we can totally turn back!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Nope.{#Name="Zero"}
By the way, why were you completely{LF}out of touch back in the desert?{#Name="Zero"}
We were about to die of exhaustion out there.{#Name="Zero"}
They were using a song to put up{LF}some kind of magic wall.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I couldn't get in until you beat up the bad guys.{#Name="Mikhail"}
But I made sure to do my business{LF}before I came for you!{#Name="Mikhail"}
And I covered it in sand just like you taught me!{#Name="Mikhail"}
That's good, right? That's really good!{#Name="Mikhail"}
*Sigh*{#Name="Zero"}
Hey, Zero? What's wrong with Two,{LF}anyway?{#Name="Mikhail"}
She fought her own powers and lost.{#Name="Zero"}
You need a strong mind to withstand{LF}the power of a song.{#Name="Zero"}
She didn't have it.{#Name="Zero"}
So she's just sick, right?{LF}Can we cure her? Huh? Can we?{#Name="Mikhail"}
No. And besides, I'm trying to kill{LF}her here!{#Name="Zero"}
Just one left, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yep. Let's finish this!{#Name="Zero"}
Get 'em, Zero, get 'em!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Me? You're the one who has to get 'em!{#Name="Zero"}
Lady Two's angel... It's losing its armor...{#Name="Cent"}
Yeah, 'cause we're attacking it!{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, my. If it loses it all, this will be bad.{LF}Very, very bad...{#Name="Cent"}
Don't relax yet, friends.{LF}This show is faaar from over!{#Name="Cent"}
Zero, look! He's running away!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Don't let 'em get away!{#Name="Zero"}
Kill Two.{#Name=" "}
Defeat the Egregori!{#Name=" "}
