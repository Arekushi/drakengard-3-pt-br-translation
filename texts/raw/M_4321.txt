Up ahead! I can feel the song up ahead!{#Name="Mikhail"}
You sure? I didn't think Three could fly.{#Name="Zero"}
I can feel it, Zero! She's here! I know it!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Lady Zero! How does it look up there!?{#Name="Octa"}
You mean other than the goddamn gargoyle cubes?{#Name="Zero"}
Gargoyle cubes? Oh dear...{#Name="Octa"}
What's wrong?{#Name="Zero"}
Those cubes require massive amounts{LF}of magical energy to operate.{#Name="Octa"}
It's highly doubtful Lady Three{LF}could ever power them alone.{#Name="Octa"}
There must be some kind of power source nearby.{#Name="Octa"}
Heh heh... Of course there is. OF COURSE!{#Name="Zero"}
スリイは元々ちょっとオカシイ奴だったからな{#Name="ゼロ"}

Redeem thyself, Ezrael!{#Name="Three"}
Z-Zero? I think that's...{#Name="Mikhail"}
I think that's an ancient dragon!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Damn, this is annoying. Quit jumpin' around!{#Name="Zero"}
Rrrgh! He's too fast for me! I can't aim right!{#Name="Mikhail"}
...Plus he's scary! His eyes are REALLY scary!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Goddammit! How can something that damn big be that damn fast!?{#Name="Zero"}

Decadus? How did you get here?{#Name="Zero"}
I had Octa give me a boost.{#Name="Decadus"}
That's...kind of amazing.{#Name="Zero"}
You appear to be in some trouble.{#Name="Decadus"}
Yeah, I can't hit this twitchy son of a bitch.{#Name="Zero"}
Leave it to me.{#Name="Decadus"}
My angel holds the power to slow down his movements by a considerable degree.{#Name="Decadus"}
Sounds great. Get on with it!{#Name="Zero"}
Err... But if I use such power, I'll go back to being a bird...{#Name="Decadus"}
Your lack of pity is intoxicating...{#Name="Decadus"}
What, you wanna call it off?{#Name="Zero"}
You'd deny me this pleasure?{#Name="Decadus"}
No. I must do this. It is my...reward...{#Name="Decadus"}
Armaros, uphold!{#Name="Decadus"}
Let's move!{#Name="Zero"}
Three?{#Name="Zero"}
Oh... Hey there, Zero.{#Name="Three"}
So...the flower's not driving{LF}you crazy or anything?{#Name="Zero"}
Nope. I'm aaaaaa-okay.{#Name="Three"}
I guess you were kinda crazy to begin with.{#Name="Zero"}
Heh heh.{#Name="Three"}
Look, Zero! Check it out! I summoned{LF}an ancient dragon all by myself!{#Name="Three"}
The hell are you yammering on about?{#Name="Zero"}
It's the flower's force at work! See?{LF}I'm just like you! Hee hee hee hee!{#Name="Three"}
The Three I know isn't this cheery.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh...really? So I'm just... I'm just...{#Name="Three"}
Just a raven hiding in the veil of night.{#Name="Three"}
Just a skeleton beneath the waves.{LF}I want to die...{#Name="Three"}
Oh yeah? I can arrange that.{#Name="Zero"}
Just kidding!{#Name="Three"}
I've got an ancient dragon on my side, remember!?{#Name="Three"}
Now it's YOUR turn to die! {#Name="Three"}
Zeeeeeerrrooooooooo!{#Name="Three"}

I guess that explains all the magical energy!{#Name="Zero"}
I don't like this, Zero. I don't like this at all.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Fighting an ancient dragon is bad...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Huh? What do you mean?{#Name="Zero"}
It's bad, Zero! I don't know why, I just know!{#Name="Mikhail"}
We dragons, we can't fight them...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Don't worry about it.{#Name="Zero"}
Urrgh...{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's gonna be fine.{#Name="Zero"}
B-But, Zero! He's...{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's gonna be fine.{#Name="Zero"}
But...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Have I ever lied to you?{#Name="Zero"}
W-Well...no. I mean, you're all{LF}stabby and angry and stuff, but...{#Name="Mikhail"}
No, you never lied to me.{#Name="Mikhail"}
See?{#Name="Zero"}
So trust me.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm here with you. And it's going to be okay.{#Name="Zero"}

Now's our chance, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
I'm sick of this shithead. Finish him!{#Name="Zero"}
