Ugh, the ocean again? I hate it here.{#Name="Dito"}
Reminds me of all those horrible nights with ol' Blubber Bags.{#Name="Dito"}
It couldn't have been easy having to come face-to-face{LF}with a woman like Five every single day.{#Name="Zero"}
I actually almost feel bad for you.{#Name="Zero"}
Imagine how bad you think it was, then multiply that{LF}by about a gazillion.{#Name="Dito"}
Just smelling the ocean makes me wanna blow chunks.{#Name="Dito"}
It reminds me of her sweat and her meaty thighs and...{LF}Uuugh.{#Name="Dito"}
Wish I could just put a stick in my brain and carve out{LF}the memories...{#Name="Dito"}
The ocean is large indeed, isn't it?{#Name="Decadus"}
First time?{#Name="Zero"}
No. But I was busy fighting last time.{#Name="Decadus"}
I didn't have a chance to behold its beauty for myself.{#Name="Decadus"}
Kinda nice to see you excited about something{LF}that doesn't involve pain.{#Name="Zero"}
Oooh... Your words wound me deeply...{#Name="Decadus"}
Er, Lady Zero? Is it true there are giant squid in the seas?{#Name="Decadus"}
What are you so happy about, Octa?{#Name="Zero"}
You a big fan of the sea or something?{#Name="Zero"}
Absolutely, my lady! It simply sends my heart soaring!{#Name="Octa"}
I, too, enjoy it. All this beautiful color bursting out at me...{LF}I can feel my heart flying away!{#Name="Decadus"}
Yes, quite beautiful. ...Plus, I've always dreamed of{LF}having a wild bout of fornication within these waves!{#Name="Octa"}
Heh... You're nothing if not consistent, I guess.{#Name="Zero"}
My lady! Perhaps you would be so good as to{LF}help me realize my ocean fantasy?{#Name="Octa"}
Believe it or not, this is actually my first time at the ocean.{#Name="Cent"}
Oh yeah?{#Name="Zero"}
...Ha! Just kidding! It's not.{#Name="Cent"}
Did I shock you? Mmm?{#Name="Cent"}
I've been working on that little nugget all day,{LF}so I hope you enjoyed it!{#Name="Cent"}
Yeah, that was a real...thing, Cent.{#Name="Zero"}
The only shock here is what an idiot that guy is.{#Name="Dito"}
Ah, it's so hard being popular...{#Name="Cent"}
Wow, Zero! I missed this place! I really missed it!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah? I didn't miss it at all. And stop repeating yourself.{#Name="Zero"}
Aw, why not? We lived here a whole year, remember?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah. A year spent watching you piss yourself like an idiot.{#Name="Zero"}
I've been trying to forget it.{LF}...And you.{#Name="Zero"}
Aw, come on!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey, Zero! Promise me we'll go swim in the sea{LF}again together someday, okay? You promise?{#Name="Mikhail"}
So, what brings us back to the Land of Seas, my lady?{#Name="Octa"}
I, uh... I forgot something at home.{#Name="Zero"}
What? We came all the way here for THAT!?{#Name="Dito"}
Yeah, we did. Now shut up already.{#Name="Zero"}
What did you forget?{#Name="Decadus"}
Look, I just... I need to check on something, all right?{#Name="Zero"}
わかりますぅう。{LF}私も家を出たとたん、{LF}鍵かけたかどうか気になるクチですからぁあ{#Name="セント"}
So if Accord's telling the truth about this "branch" stuff...{#Name="Zero"}
Maybe there's a world where the flower doesn't appear.{#Name="Zero"}
There's gotta be a hint or something that can lead me there...{#Name="Zero"}
The arm I lost to One...{#Name="Zero"}
If that's when the branch occurred, I'm already too late.{#Name="Zero"}
ワンへの借りは、返す{#Name="ゼロ"}
Could there really be a world without this flower?{#Name="Zero"}
I wonder what I'm like over there? Or what my sisters are like.{LF}...Do I even HAVE sisters?{#Name="Zero"}
Meh, no point dwelling on it.{#Name="Zero"}
花が……疼くな{#Name="ゼロ"}
Medicine...{#Name="Zero"}
I managed to survive, but at what cost?{#Name="Zero"}
My body is cursed now, and the stupid thing{LF}won't even let me die.{#Name="Zero"}
All those guys who call me the accursed Intoner{LF}are more right than they know.{#Name="Zero"}
私にはもう、薬は必要無い{#Name="ゼロ"}
If I'm the singularity Accord was talking about,{#Name="Zero"}
then maybe I'm the one bringing this world to ruin.{#Name="Zero"}
Meh, no point dwelling on it.{#Name="Zero"}
I think it's time to talk to Accord face-to-face.{#Name="Zero"}
April the 20th, 1000 A.D.{#Name="Accord"}
The Land of Seas.{#Name="Accord"}
Sooo...if this is the end of this branch, then... Wait, what?{#Name="Accord"}
Oh, gosh, I didn't lose a recording by accident, did I?{#Name="Accord"}
And what happened to the branches between A and C?{#Name="Accord"}
Ugh. If I screw this up, I'm gonna be in sooo much trouble...{#Name="Accord"}
Okay, just breathe.{LF}For starters, let's check out recording M1410_E0002_FL...{#Name="Accord"}
