Well, this is odd.{#Name="Octa"}
What?{#Name="Zero"}
There are supposed to be faeries in this area.{#Name="Octa"}
I don't see anything.{#Name="Zero"}
Ah HA! See? The poison gas has killed every last—{#Name="Cent"}
Please shut up.{#Name="Dito"}
Good heavens. Are those trolls?{#Name="Octa"}
Ugh. Trolls. Ugly, smelly, and dumb...{LF}They deserve to die.{#Name="Dito"}
That's rather judgmental of you.{#Name="Decadus"}
You're damn right it's judgmental!{#Name="Dito"}
Hell, we're doing these jackasses{LF}a FAVOR by killing 'em!{#Name="Dito"}
I mean, it's not like they're gonna do{LF}anything worthwhile with their lives.{#Name="Dito"}
Trust me. They'll be much happier{LF}once they're dead.{#Name="Dito"}
I wonder what Lady Three was{LF}trying to tell us earlier.{#Name="Decadus"}
She said Lady One is in this forest, yes?{#Name="Decadus"}
And that she holds a secret of some sort?{#Name="Decadus"}
The mysteries multiply amongst themselves...{#Name="Decadus"}
I, too, have been considering{LF}this question at some length.{#Name="Octa"}
But alas, whenever I think of Lady Three,{LF}my mind is distracted by non-stop images{LF}of our epic late-night fleshmongering...{#Name="Octa"}
You aren't even trying, are you?{#Name="Zero"}
Lady Zero, look out!{#Name="Decadus"}
A titan? Here? That's a bit...unexpected.{#Name="Cent"}
What did you do to deserve such punishment, eh?{#Name="Cent"}
'Cause I know I didn't do anything,{LF}so it must have been you.{#Name="Cent"}
Quit whining and do your damn job!{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, come on. Now it's a centaur?{#Name="Dito"}
What is this, a goddamn monster amusement park!?{#Name="Dito"}
The beasts of this forest have{LF}changed, to be sure...{#Name="Octa"}
We'd best track down Lady One with all haste.{#Name="Octa"}
Agreed.{#Name="Zero"}
But first we kill my pretty pony here.{LF}Then we can go find One.{#Name="Zero"}
Here they come!{#Name="Soldier A"}
We have to stop them here!{#Name="Soldier B"}
What're we gonna do!? More and more of us are falling ill!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Yeah, well that illness won't mean shit if they get past us here!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Where'd Lady Three go?{#Name="Soldier A"}
Back into the forest!{#Name="Soldier C"}
If only Lady Three were here with us!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Dammit! Wh-What the hell is happening!?{#Name="Soldier C"}
Is this fog the will of Lady Three?{#Name="Soldier F"}
Nnngh...{#Name="Soldier C"}
This is an ill mist. Try not to breathe too deeply!{#Name="Soldier D"}
*Huff, huff...* D-Dammit... I can't breathe...{#Name="Soldier G"}
If she's made it this far, our front line must have been annihilated!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Don't think about that right now!{#Name="Soldier G"}
The hell is up with this forest...?{#Name="Zero"}
