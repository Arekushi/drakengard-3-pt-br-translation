Could it BE any more damp around here?{LF}Even my sweat is sweaty.{#Name="Dito"}
Urrrgh...{#Name="Decadus"}
I know, right? This place blows chunks.{#Name="Dito"}
Yes, but the discomfort is somehow...exhilarating...{#Name="Decadus"}
Yeah, whatever, freak.{#Name="Dito"}
I vote we ditch this place ASAP.{#Name="Dito"}
Decadus. Gimme some cloth, will ya?{#Name="Zero"}
Are you hurt, my lady?{#Name="Decadus"}
No, this stupid forest made my period come early.{#Name="Zero"}

...Dito's right. You are a freak.{#Name="Zero"}
H-Here, my lady. Have all the cloth you want.{#Name="Decadus"}
Oh ho! Well, isn't this strange?{#Name="Octa"}
The forest up ahead used to be far more lush{LF}and verdant than this.{#Name="Octa"}
Something has happened since last I visited.{LF}I can feel it!{#Name="Octa"}
You can "feel" it? Goodness, what a load of{LF}superstitious nonsense.{#Name="Cent"}
I, of course, reject such mystic foolishness{LF}in favor of science.{#Name="Cent"}
Proof! Theories! Experimentation!{LF}This is the way of the world!{#Name="Cent"}
Buuut I probably shouldn't expect you Neanderthals{LF}to understand any of that.{#Name="Cent"}
Cram it, professor.{#Name="Dito"}
いいから、黙れ{#Name="ディト"}
Lady Zero, if I may?{LF}We should avoid mingling in this fog for long.{#Name="Octa"}
Three's inside this forest, right?{LF}She's here, isn't she?{#Name="Mikhail"}
You seem awfully pleased about that.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm just excited to meet one of your sisters!{#Name="Mikhail"}

Aw, come on!{#Name="Mikhail"}
I just hope we get to eat before fighting.{LF}I'm useless on an empty tummy!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey, Cent. What do you know about Two?{#Name="Zero"}
Two? Two, Two, Two...{LF}Yeah, sorry. Don't know her.{#Name="Cent"}
You mean you...forgot her?{#Name="Zero"}
How can I forget a person I've never met?{#Name="Cent"}
I'm pretty sure I'd remember a silly name like "Two."{#Name="Cent"}
All right, guys. Time to go.{#Name="Zero"}
You want me to go butt roll ahead, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's "patrol," dummy! Not "butt roll!"{#Name="Zero"}
That's what I said! That's totally what I said!{#Name="Mikhail"}
You know, I keep waiting for him to get smarter,{LF}but it's just not happening.{#Name="Dito"}
How 'bout it, Cent? Wanna add some biting wit{LF}to the situation?{#Name="Dito"}
...Aw, come on. Gimme something. Anything! {#Name="Dito"}
Hmm? ...What?{#Name="Cent"}
Oh, so NOW you decide to be normal?{LF}Pffft. Forget it. You're useless.{#Name="Dito"}
I just...can't stop thinking about this Two person...{#Name="Cent"}
Time doesn't always flow in a single direction.{#Name="Accord"}
Divergence: Branch B{#Name="Accord"}
In the flow of post-Cataclysm history,{#Name="Accord"}
if a unique set of conditions known as "singularities" come together,{#Name="Accord"}
splits occur in time, resulting in the multiple-world divergence phenomenon.{#Name="Accord"}
It is now April the 1st, 1000 A.D.,{#Name="Accord"}
28 days since the singularity known as Zero resumed activity.{#Name="Accord"}
The first anomaly occurred when Zero encountered the old man known as Octa...{#Name="Accord"}
And the forest they were expected to enter manifested in a different form...{#Name="Accord"}
