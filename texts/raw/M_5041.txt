Back then, I didn't know.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I didn't know that defeating One wasn't the end.{#Name="Mikhail"}

We can't defeat her...{#Name="Soldier A"}
Enemy sighted! What the...?{#Name="Soldier G"}
What is it?{#Name="Soldier E"}
She's alone. Zero's by herself!{#Name="Soldier G"}

Come on! We can still do this!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Anyone who can fight, get to the front! Defend us!{#Name="Soldier B"}

She doesn't seem to be weakened!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Damned Intoner...{#Name="Soldier F"}
Help! She's breaking through!{#Name="Soldier E"}

Aaaaahh!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Enough already! We're wasting good soldiers' lives!{#Name="Soldier A"}
戦なんて、最初から全部無駄だ{#Name="兵士Ｆ"}

ああ…ワン様を守りぬこう。それが、世界を守ることになる！{#Name="兵士Ｅ"}
All our soldiers are wounded!{#Name="Soldier F"}

Holy shit, it's Zero! She's here!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Anyone else?{#Name="Soldier A"}
No, sir! She appears to be alone!{#Name="Soldier G"}
What happened to her friends?{#Name="Soldier B"}
She probably used 'em up and then killed 'em!{#Name="Soldier E"}
I don't see any disciples!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Forward! Forward!{#Name="Soldier D"}
The front line's...wiped out?{#Name="Soldier F"}

There's a man down over here, too!{#Name="Soldier D"}
自分達でなんとかしろ！救護班もやられておる{#Name="兵士Ｆ"}

Calm down! You're out of formation!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Don't give up! Keep pushing!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Stop her! Stop her now!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Intoner or not, how can one woman{LF}fight off all these troops?{#Name="Soldier F"}
She's trying to end the world by herself.{LF}She's obviously pretty fuckin' strong!{#Name="Soldier E"}
This is hell on earth...{#Name="Soldier C"}

Dammit! If this keeps up, Lady One's in trouble!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Protect the Cathedral! Don't let Zero inside!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Whatcha readin'?{#Name="Zero"}
Ah, Zero.{#Name="One"}
It's a record of life in the Cathedral City.{#Name="One"}
A record of life?{#Name="Zero"}
Zero, don't you think it's strange?{#Name="One"}
This city is said to be the origin of all magic.{#Name="One"}
Spells were crafted here that even now are far beyond our abilities.{#Name="One"}
Where did this knowledge go? When did we lose it?{#Name="One"}
And what happened to the people who once possessed it?{#Name="One"}
I thought if I studied that, I might be able{LF}to learn the purpose of Intoners. Of...us.{#Name="One"}
Only an idiot tries to learn about a bunch of shit{LF}she doesn't need to know. Or did you not know that?{#Name="Zero"}
That's rather close-minded.{#Name="One"}
Though, in the sense that we cannot ever truly know everything...{LF}Well, I suppose I agree.{#Name="One"}
Whatever.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm about to kill you anyway. That's all that matters.{#Name="Zero"}
...So predictable.{#Name="One"}
Come to me, Gabriel.{#Name="One"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
Dragon!{#Name="Zero"}
You all right!?{#Name="Zero"}
Y-Yeah...{#Name="Mikhail"}
But that guy's strong... He's really, really strong!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Zero, get on! Let's beat him together!{#Name="Mikhail"}
145{#Name="145"}
I know how this goes, my sister.{#Name="One"}
Not even you can recover from a mortal dragon wound.{#Name="One"}
Then I guess I just have to kill you first!{#Name="Zero"}
You and your daemon dragon...{#Name="Zero"}
Huh? What's that mean?{#Name="Mikhail"}
It means she enhanced her dragon{LF}to make it better at fighting you.{#Name="Zero"}
But when you do that...{#Name="Zero"}
Hey, Zero? Why are we fighting?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Are you seriously asking me that now?{#Name="Zero"}
I mean... It's just kind of sad, you know?{LF}It's sad.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I feel really bad for Gabriel.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Really? You feel bad for the fucker{LF}that's trying to kill you!?{#Name="Zero"}
Dammit! Does anything hurt him!?{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
You all right!?{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
Shit!{#Name="Zero"}
Reincarnate! Even if you lose your memory, at least you'll still—{#Name="Zero"}
You know, right, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Why dragons can be reborn? Because they get a "final wish."{#Name="Mikhail"}
Enough! Just hurry up and do it already!{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
A dragon's wish is a deep and powerful thing...{#Name="Mikhail"}
So now, I'm gonna make mine.{#Name="Mikhail"}
And I'm gonna kill that dragon!{#Name="Mikhail"}
What're you saying!?{#Name="Zero"}
If I use my life to wish it...then I can make it happen. Isn't that great!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
...No. No! No, no, no! I'm not letting you do this! NO!{#Name="Zero"}
It's okay, Zero.{#Name="Mikhail"}
If I lose my memory, I won't be me anymore anyway.{#Name="Mikhail"}
No! No, no... Please, no...{#Name="Zero"}
And besides... I had a lot of fun, Zero...{#Name="Mikhail"}
I mean, being with you...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Mikhail, no! You can't! I won't let you!{#Name="Zero"}
Heh... Look at that... You finally used my name... My...name...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Goddammit, dummy... Stop repeating things...{#Name="Zero"}
Mik...hail...{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="One"}
You're...not...{#Name="One"}
the only one...who's ready...to sacrifice everything...{#Name="One"}
{06}>{#Name="One"}
I will protect Gabriel...{#Name="One"}
Even if... Even if I forsake my life...as an Intoner!{#Name="One"}
Come for me, Zero!{#Name="One"}
Die!{#Name="Zero"}
You comprehend nothing!{#Name="One"}
You destroy the peace we created!{#Name="One"}
You kill your own flesh and blood!{#Name="One"}
And then...you think...{#Name="One"}
You think you can save the WORLD!?{#Name="One"}
You done running your mouth yet?{#Name="Zero"}
Mikhail...{#Name="Zero"}
Why wasn't it me...?{#Name="Zero"}
Mikhail... Mikhail still had a future...{#Name="Zero"}
Damn it. Goddamn it all!{#Name="Zero"}
Do you honestly think this will{LF}be enough to destroy us!?{#Name="One"}
All of us... Five, Four, Three, Two, and One...{#Name="One"}
We won't lose, Zero! And the world won't, either!{#Name="One"}
You're the monster who made{LF}the Intoners in the first place!{#Name="One"}
Dammit...{#Name="One"}
Farewell, Gabriel...{#Name="One"}
I'm...sorry...{#Name="One"}
......{#Name="Zero"}
So this is...{#Name="One"}
Good...bye...{#Name="One"}
Yeah. It is.{#Name="Zero"}
Mikhail... It's over.{#Name="Zero"}
Now I—{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
O-One!?{#Name="Zero"}
But how...?{#Name="Zero"}
Brother.{#Name="? ? ?"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
I'm One's brother.{#Name="? ? ?"}
Brother? That's...impossible...{#Name="Zero"}
You wouldn't know. You only had your five sisters.{#Name="? ? ?"}
But in the same way you "created" your sisters...{#Name="? ? ?"}
Your sister One created me.{#Name="? ? ?"}
I was a failsafe in case you managed to kill her.{#Name="? ? ?"}
I was her final weapon.{#Name="? ? ?"}
See this sword? It's made from a dragon's fang.{#Name="? ? ?"}
That means it can kill an Intoner, right?{#Name="? ? ?"}
I...see...{#Name="Zero"}
You have no one to blame but yourself, murderer!{#Name="? ? ?"}
{06}>{#Name="? ? ?"}
I don't...blame...anyone.{#Name="Zero"}
I just want to kill the Intoners. ...All of them.{#Name="Zero"}
You think after all this I intended to...survive?{#Name="Zero"}
The world doesn't...work that way...{#Name="Zero"}
At last...it's all over...{#Name="Zero"}
Mik...hail.{#Name="Zero"}
Thank y—{#Name="Zero"}
...She's dead.{#Name="? ? ?"}
Zero is dead.{#Name="? ? ?"}
One, do you hear me?{#Name="? ? ?"}
I finished off the Intoners, just like you said!{#Name="? ? ?"}
But...what should I do now?{#Name="? ? ?"}
How am I supposed to live...in a world that lacks the Intoners' protection?{#Name="? ? ?"}
...One.{#Name="? ? ?"}
I see... If there are no Intoners left to protect the world...{#Name="? ? ?{0A}(One's Brother)"}
Then I'll just protect it myself!{#Name="? ? ?{0A}(One's Brother)"}
We'll form a new religion.{#Name="? ? ?{0A}(One's Brother)"}
A religion that worships my sister, One.{#Name="? ? ?{0A}(One's Brother)"}
...No, I am the true One.{#Name="? ? ?{0A}(One's Brother)"}
From this day forward, all will call ME One!{#Name="One{0A}(One's Brother)"}
{06}>{#Name="One{0A}(One's Brother)"}
I should have known this branch would also end like this.{#Name="? ? ?{0A}(Accord)"}
Seems like we should've taken a different branch somewhere along the way...{#Name="? ? ?{0A}(Accord)"}
Zero! My attacks aren't working!{LF}They aren't working!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Slam into him once he opens his big, fat mouth!{#Name="Zero"}
If a good smack in the mouth don't work,{LF}I dunno what will. Such a pain...{#Name="Zero"}
I'm gonna hit my head if I fly around in here!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Maybe that'll smarten you up a bit!{#Name="Zero"}
That's mean, Zero! Look, I'm not flying in here!{LF}I'm not!{#Name="Mikhail"}
