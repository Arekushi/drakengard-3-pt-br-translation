It's Zero! Damn her to hell!{#Name="Soldier A"}
She's horrifying! Nothing like our Lady Two!{#Name="Soldier F"}
There she is! All men, take positions!{#Name="Soldier B"}
I will gladly sacrifice myself for the sake of Lady Two!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Me to—er, as well!{#Name="Soldier D"}
We can't let her get anywhere near Lady Two!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Lady Two must never be befouled!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Send word a threat approaches! Lady Two is in danger!{#Name="Soldier A"}
595{#Name="595"}
Give me 125 percent! You'll need it all against this devil!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Zero is... She's terrifying!{#Name="Soldier F"}
I want a world where Lady Two can always be happy!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Stop the demon here and now!{#Name="Soldier E"}
The time is now! Remember your training, men!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Lady Two watches over us! I'm sure of it!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Open a path! We're carrying wounded here!{#Name="Soldier A"}
I'm not dead yet... But I'll take you to hell with me!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Our sacrifice here will ensure Lady Two lives on!{#Name="Soldier E"}
It's the end of the world... We've all gone mad!{#Name="Soldier F"}
How can this demon be an Intoner!?{#Name="Soldier E"}
A...a false Intoner!?{#Name="Soldier C"}
Who knows! Just be careful!{#Name="Soldier E"}
That woman is a disgrace to Lady Two and everything she stands for!{#Name="Soldier E"}
We'll be fine so long as Lady Two is with us!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Actually, some equipment might help!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Believe in Lady Two, and you will feel no fear!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Surely Lady Two hasn't forsaken us, has she?{#Name="Soldier B"}
Don't be ridiculous!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Our perfect goddess would never betray us! ...Not like some of the girls I know, anyway!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Look out! It's Zero!{#Name="Soldier B"}
To think an Intoner could be so vile!{#Name="Soldier F"}
No retreat! How would we ever face Lady Two!?{#Name="Soldier C"}
Dammit! You're going down!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Don't worry about positioning! Just fight!{#Name="Soldier E"}
All men, forward! Fight for your very lives!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Yaaahhhhh!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Dammit! Where the hell is Two!?{#Name="Zero"}
Easy, Z. It ain't like they're just{LF}gonna hand her over to us.{#Name="Dito"}
Then we're just gonna have to take her!{#Name="Zero"}
Lady Zero, I'm sensing something from Mikhail.{#Name="Decadus"}
Crap. Did he keel over already?{#Name="Zero"}
No, but he is struggling.{LF}I fear he is near his limit.{#Name="Decadus"}
Cent!{#Name="Zero"}
Yeees?{#Name="Cent"}
I need you to think, okay?{LF}Where's Two? What's her weakness?{#Name="Zero"}
You've gotta know something. Come on! Chop chop!{#Name="Zero"}
Give me a moment, will you?{#Name="Cent"}
Even someone with a massive brain like me{LF}needs time to process things, you know?{#Name="Cent"}
You've got two seconds.{LF}After that, I start kicking balls.{#Name="Zero"}
These foes are quite stubborn, hmm?{LF}We must hurry.{#Name="Octa"}
I wish I could burn these ruins{LF}and everyone in them.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh ho ho! Always so impulsive...{#Name="Octa"}
Still, I understand. You must be{LF}worried for your dragon.{#Name="Octa"}
I am no such thing!{#Name="Zero"}
You gonna be okay, Z?{#Name="Dito"}
What's that supposed to mean?{#Name="Zero"}
Nothing! It's just...I know how you feel{LF}about these types of situations...{#Name="Dito"}
I'm fine.{#Name="Zero"}
Here we go again...{#Name="Cent"}
This may not be the wisest course of action...{#Name="Octa"}
Relax. I got this.{#Name="Zero"}
Please reconsider, my lady.{LF}None would think lesser of you.{#Name="Decadus"}
Enough already!{#Name="Zero"}
I said I got this! What kind of an{LF}idiot do you take me for!?{#Name="Zero"}
Watch and learn, chumps!{#Name="Zero"}
...Don't say a word.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, I wasn't gonna.{#Name="Dito"}
No "I told you so"...{LF}No "Look how stupid you are"...{#Name="Dito"}
Nope! My lips are sealed.{#Name="Dito"}
Your lips'll be torn off if you don't shut it.{#Name="Zero"}
Finally! This is more my style.{#Name="Zero"}
All that jumpin' around was driving me crazy.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm a lot better at slashing people to death. {#Name="Zero"}
なるほど、性に合ってますな。たしかに{#Name="オクタ"}
The city is Lady Two's fortress!{LF}It must be protected at all costs!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Hee hee hee hee hee! Lady Two... I see her!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Snap out of it! You're hallucinating!{#Name="Soldier F"}
The unclean must never be allowed{LF}to set foot in the Cathedral City!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Indeed! How dare Zero put herself{LF}on equal footing with Lady Two!{#Name="Soldier E"}
As long as Lady Two is there for me,{LF}I desire nothing else!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Bow before Lady Two, false Intoner!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Fight for Lady Two!{LF}Our leader is the savior of all mankind!{#Name="Soldier A"}
You! Where's your equipment?{#Name="Soldier F"}
Fear not! Lady Two is my sword!{LF}Lady Two is my shield!{#Name="Soldier G"}
The winds of Lady Two shall blow{LF}like a righteous hurricane!{#Name="Soldier G"}
These guys are fuckin' weird.{#Name="Zero"}
You said it.{#Name="Cent"}
'Course, who am I to talk? Look at you guys.{#Name="Zero"}
Keep your equipment, men! Stay in formation!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Man down! Man down over here!{#Name="Soldier C"}
The moment of judgment is here!{LF}Lady Two sees and knows all!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Look out! Wounded soldier here!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Okay. This is a bit creepy.{#Name="Zero"}
Yeah. They're turning into a bunch of fanatics.{#Name="Dito"}
A person's belief system can often{LF}push them over the brink.{#Name="Octa"}
These foes are quite stubborn, hmm?{LF}We must hurry.{#Name="Octa"}
I wish I could burn these ruins{LF}and everyone in them.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh ho ho! Always so impulsive...{#Name="Octa"}
Still, I understand. You must be{LF}worried for your dragon.{#Name="Octa"}
I am no such thing!{#Name="Zero"}
ここにもオカシイ奴がいたか{#Name="ゼロ"}
トウは居なかったな……{#Name=" "}
Is that the path to the exit?{#Name="Zero"}
I suppose that means Lady Two{LF}was never here at all.{#Name="Decadus"}
Yet we've heard the soldiers speak{LF}of the Cathedral City many times.{#Name="Octa"}
Cathedral City... That must be where One is.{#Name="Zero"}
469{#Name="469"}
577{#Name="577"}
Then let's head to the Cathedral City.{#Name="Zero"}
