Lady Two is with us all!{#Name="Soldier A"}
It's all right! Everything will be all right!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Lady Two is the one true creator! Even if the world ends, we will survive! {#Name="Soldier B"}
Indeed! Any world that resists Lady Two must be torn to shreds!{#Name="Soldier C"}
N-No... NO! I don't want to die!{#Name="Soldier G"}
You will not die, my child.{#Name="Soldier F"}
You will be the foundation upon which Lady Two builds a better world!{#Name="Soldier F"}
No! Spare me! Lemme go! Pleeeease!{#Name="Soldier G"}
That's it... Keeeeeep smiling... It's almost over now...{#Name="Soldier F"}
There she is! The putrid demon they call Zero!{#Name="Soldier E"}
We offer ourselves to Lady Two!{#Name="Soldier D"}
The offering must be made!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Soon, very soon, all on this world shall be judged!{#Name="Soldier B"}
What can I do for Lady Two?{#Name="Soldier C"}
What should I be doing!? Somebody! Please, tell me!{#Name="Soldier C"}
All hail Lady Two! All hail Lady Twoooo!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Hail our Lady! Hail our Lady!{#Name="Soldier B"}
The day of judgment is nigh! We shall rise and attain a higher dimension!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Lady Two is the holy trinity! Mother, wife, and daughter of mankind!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Pluck the rotten flower from the face of the false Intoner!{#Name="Soldier G"}
That blossom is an affront to Lady Two!{#Name="Soldier G"}
We have drunk from the cup of holy water! We are invincible!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Yeahhh!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Lady Two's holy water is within us!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Lady Two is a spring of righteousness! Her divinity can conjure miracles!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Your faith is lacking! Your blasphemy will be punished!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Yes! Faith is all that matters in this world!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Bow before Lady Two! Beg her righteous forgiveness!{#Name="Soldier C"}
This world is beyond help! None of us can save it now.{#Name="Soldier D"}
Oh, God, I'm so dead... They're gonna kill me!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Believe in Lady Two and she will resurrect you in the bounty of the afterlife!{#Name="Soldier D"}
I believe in Lady Two, I swear it! I believe, I belieeeeve!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Those who have yet to awaken are always quick to wail and scream. How pathetic!{#Name="Soldier F"}
The true world is bathed in the innocent beauty of Lady Two!{#Name="Soldier F"}
If Two and One are both in the city,{LF}that'll save me some killin' time.{#Name="Zero"}
Let me... Let me help you out, too.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Sure. Fly up and scout ahead, okay?{#Name="Zero"}
S-Sure, Zero! You got it!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Aw, look at you trying to keep him safe.{#Name="Dito"}
You're just a big ol' cupcake, Z. You know that?{#Name="Dito"}
If Two and One are both in the city,{LF}that'll save me some killin' time.{#Name="Zero"}
The miracle is still alive! Believe in Lady Two!{#Name="Soldier A"}
If only Zero would bow to Lady Two's divine wisdom!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Lady Two is indestructible! Invincible! Immortal!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Fire! Fiiiiiire!{#Name="Soldier E"}
They're moving too fast!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Where's your faith in Lady Two!?{LF}She will protect us!{#Name="Soldier E"}
I'm the 1597th man in line to{LF}receive Lady Two's salvation!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Who are these guys?{#Name="Zero"}
Such fanaticism resembles the withdrawal{LF}symptoms of certain medications.{#Name="Octa"}
What, so they're addicts?{LF}What are they addicted to?{#Name="Zero"}
Her song, I'd imagine.{#Name="Cent"}
Hey, Cent actually made sense!{LF}Give him a hand, everyone!{#Name="Dito"}
With Lady Two gone, the power{LF}of her song also vanishes.{#Name="Decadus"}
Thus leading to the sad state{LF}of affairs before us.{#Name="Decadus"}
Stupid dog. I'm gonna rip you apart!{#Name="Zero"}
Goddammit! Not another one!{#Name="Zero"}
I fear our enemies have picked{LF}up on Lady Zero's weakness.{#Name="Decadus"}
Weakness?{#Name="Zero"}
Your dislike of performing the same{LF}task over and over and over again.{#Name="Decadus"}
Who asked you, you freaky gimp!{#Name="Zero"}
Did you call me, Zero? Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Don't look so happy. Just do what{LF}you're here to do already. ...And{LF}when you're done, get some rest.{#Name="Zero"}
Thanks, Zero! I'll try double hard, okay?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Can we get to the Cathedral City{LF}from this path up ahead?{#Name="Cent"}
Hmm...{#Name="Accord"}
Dragons devolving...{LF}Disciples abandoning their Intoners...{#Name="Accord"}
A branch this strange merits very careful study.{#Name="Accord"}
Rather a lot of undead around here...{#Name="Octa"}
They're likely recycling the{LF}bodies of fallen soldiers.{#Name="Decadus"}
Perhaps this is yet another symptom{LF}of Lady Two's absence.{#Name="Octa"}
