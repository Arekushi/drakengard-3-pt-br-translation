What're you doing with your fingers?{#Name="Zero"}
Countin' all the bad stuff in this forest.{#Name="Dito"}
We got poison... We got the undead...{LF}We got trolls... We got titans...{#Name="Dito"}
This is hardly my idea of a good time.{#Name="Dito"}
I thought you enjoyed killing ugly things.{#Name="Zero"}
Figured you'd be happy as a pig in shit right now.{#Name="Zero"}
...Pfft.{#Name="Dito"}
There's something... I don't know, man.{LF}There's just something wrong about this place.{#Name="Dito"}
It feels like this forest is falling apart.{LF}As if everything is somehow...losing cohesion.{#Name="Decadus"}
Right? It's making me feel all sick and stuff.{#Name="Dito"}
Indeed. I am wracked with discomfort as well.{#Name="Decadus"}
Such terrible...beautiful discomfort... Nnnngh...{#Name="Decadus"}
Uh oh. There he goes.{#Name="Zero"}
Indeed!{#Name="Octa"}
The end of the world may be nigh, and yet we{LF}sit here wracked with inaction...{#Name="Decadus"}
Oh, how I love to be frustrated so!{#Name="Decadus"}
You feel it too, Octa?{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, I feel something all right! Something in my trousers!{#Name="Octa"}
Besides that.{#Name="Zero"}
Dito said he felt something...weird going on around here.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh. That. Well, yes, the world does seem a tad out of balance. {#Name="Octa"}
Though that could just be all the blood that's currently{LF}rushing from my head!{#Name="Octa"}
Perhaps a brief ride on my hobby horse would help{LF}make me right again. What do you say?{#Name="Octa"}
Are we gonna be okay, Zero? I mean, with all this...{LF}important-sounding stuff you guys are talking about.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Don't butt in on things you don't understand.{#Name="Zero"}
Hey, come on! I wanna talk about important-sounding stuff too!{#Name="Mikhail"}
えっ{#Name="ミハイル"}
私の知能に追いつけるとは思わないけどぉお、そこはほらぁ{#Name="セント"}
私がレベルをさげて教えられるしぃい、{LF}てか、それができるのが真の知性だしぃい{#Name="セント"}
助けて、ゼロ！　セントが止まらない！{#Name="ミハイル"}
I just want to know what's going on.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I want to know about all kinds of things...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hmm.... Who is this woman that continues to flit about{LF}the corners of my mind?{#Name="Cent"}
She has short blue hair and mischievous eyes.{LF}I think she's...looking at me.{#Name="Cent"}
Sounds like Two.{#Name="Zero"}
Two? Hmm. So that's Two, is it?{#Name="Cent"}
Two? Hmm. So that's Two, is it?{#Name="Cent"}
That's odd. Why can't I get her face out of my mind?{#Name="Cent"}
So what do we do now?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Go deeper into the forest. There is no other choice.{#Name="Decadus"}
We need to find Lady One or Lady Three{LF}as soon as possible.{#Name="Octa"}
Maybe we can find 'em both at once.{LF}That'll certainly make things easier.{#Name="Zero"}
Update{#Name="Accord"}
The divergence triggered by the singularity known as Zero{#Name="Accord"}
has led to a wide range of observed anomalies.{#Name="Accord"}
The forest has changed, and its foes are more violent. Furthermore,{#Name="Accord"}
the singularity known as Two, and her disciple, Cent,{#Name="Accord"}
are now acting independently of one another.{#Name="Accord"}
