This is it.{#Name="Zero"}
Once the flower's in full bloom, you have to destroy it.{#Name="Zero"}
...Okay.{#Name="Mikhail"}
There's one more thing I need to tell you.{#Name="Zero"}
What?{#Name="Mikhail"}
You've grown strong...Mikhail.{#Name="Zero"}
Zero... Zero, you big dummy...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Good night...Zero.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Recording.{#Name="Accord"}
The Intoners have been sealed off in another world.{#Name="Accord"}
The threat of the flower has been extinguished from this branch.{#Name="Accord"}
However, the possibility exists that this seal{LF}could unravel at some time or location in the future.{#Name="Accord"}
Until then, our recording efforts will continue.{#Name="Accord"}
...Oh. And a personal addendum regarding my observational target, Zero.{#Name="Accord"}
Perhaps this is beyond my functional requirements as a Recorder, but{#Name="Accord"}
I cannot shake the feeling that somehow, somewhere, Zero is still alive.{#Name="Accord"}
And that...someday...{#Name="Accord"}
Someday, she and I will see each other again.{#Name="Accord"}
Crazy, I know. Call it a hunch.{#Name="Accord"}
Handover of recording duties complete.{#Name="Accord B"}
Excellent work.{#Name="Accord B"}
Well... I wonder how the future's going to unfold from here on?{#Name="Accord B"}

Right! Everyone split up and begin recording!{#Name="Accord B"}
Understood!{#Name="Accords"}
I hope to see you again someday.{#Name="Accord B"}
But until then...{#Name="Accord B"}
I'd like to say...{LF}Thank you for playing!{#Name="Accord B"}
Hey, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah?{#Name="ZERO"}
I...I had a lot of fun.{#Name="Mikhail"}
With you, I mean. It was fun being with you.{#Name="Mikhail"}
The killing was hard. It was really hard, but...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Stop repeating things.{#Name="ZERO"}
But getting to be with you, Zero.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Getting to eat next to you...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Getting to fly around with you...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Getting to have you yell at me...{#Name="Mikhail"}
And then getting to be friends again...{#Name="Mikhail"}
It was really, really fun.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I'm glad.{#Name="ZERO"}
Mikhail?{#Name="ZERO"}
Yeah?{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's...{#Name="ZERO"}
almost time.{#Name="ZERO"}
...Okay.{#Name="Mikhail"}
