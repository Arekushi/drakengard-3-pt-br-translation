Ugh! This heat is killing me.{#Name="Zero"}
The sunlight reflects off the sand,{LF}making it seem even hotter.{#Name="Octa"}
Perhaps removing your clothes{LF}would provide a bit of relief?{#Name="Octa"}
Go on! I don't mind!{LF}Just take them off right here!{#Name="Octa"}
Shut up. You're making me hotter.{#Name="Zero"}
Grrr! What the hell? It feels like I'm burning up!{#Name="Dito"}
The sunlight seems to have suddenly grown stronger.{#Name="Decadus"}
Can't we do anything about it?{LF}It's suckin' the life out of me.{#Name="Dito"}
This is no accident. There's something{LF}weird going on here.{#Name="Zero"}
Perhaps our foes are using magic{LF}to amplify the sun's rays.{#Name="Decadus"}
Here we go again with the magic.{LF}Real fuckin' convenient!{#Name="Zero"}
I wager there might be a wizard{LF}casting spells nearby.{#Name="Octa"}
Hiding like a little bitch, huh? Figures.{#Name="Dito"}
I'll tear him a new asshole! And then a third!{#Name="Zero"}
Ha ha ha! That's my Z!{#Name="Dito"}
This odious sunlight is something else.{LF}It's enough to make even me go limp!{#Name="Octa"}
We'd best stay in the shade to preserve our energy.{#Name="Decadus"}
What's wrong? Shouldn't you be{LF}complaining about something?{#Name="Zero"}
Too hot. Can't talk.{#Name="Dito"}
Perhaps a story would help!{LF}Let me tell you of the time I was in a brothel{LF}with a cactus and three lovely vixens...{#Name="Octa"}
Stop. Making it worse.{#Name="Dito"}
Is the sunlight not bothering you, my lady?{#Name="Decadus"}
It takes more than a little sunlight to hurt me. {#Name="Zero"}
Still, please don't overdo it.{LF}Best stick to the shade.{#Name="Decadus"}
Dammit, all this hiding in the shade{LF}is really starting to piss me off!{#Name="Zero"}
It's not like we have a choice.{LF}This sun is a disciple killer!{#Name="Dito"}
We aren't all invincible like you, remember?{#Name="Dito"}
Well, it still pisses me off.{#Name="Zero"}
Lady Zero, watch where you step.{#Name="Octa"}
Nnngh! This is taking forever!{LF}How big IS this area!?{#Name="Zero"}
Ho ho. Travel is like sweet love: a terribly{LF}long journey for an all-too-short climax!{#Name="Octa"}
Quit trying to be deep, Octa.{LF}It doesn't suit you.{#Name="Zero"}
*Huff, huff...*{#Name="Decadus"}
Having trouble, Decadus?{#Name="Dito"}
Nnngh... Indeed, I am... But...{LF}I will face any trial for my lady's sake.{#Name="Decadus"}
 {#Name="デカート"}
You sure it's for her? You seem awfully excited.{#Name="Dito"}
These are the fuckers who conjured{LF}up that sunlight. Kill 'em!{#Name="Zero"}
Oh ho ho! We'd better watch out.{LF}I see another conjured sun over there!{#Name="Octa"}
Oh, that's just wonderful.{#Name="Zero"}
I think I'm about to go insane.{#Name="Zero"}
Great. Now we've got a giant, flaming man-horse.{#Name="Zero"}
I don't mind any of those words{LF}on their own, but together...{#Name="Dito"}
Where's the shrine?{#Name="Zero"}
Up ahead, I'd imagine.{LF}But let's deal with this foe first.{#Name="Octa"}
It's growing weaker.{#Name="Decadus"}
Good. Let's kill it and move on already!{#Name="Zero"}
Finally... The Shrine of Sands.{#Name="Zero"}
After decimating the enemy's base,{#Name="Accord"}
Zero discovered documents pointing to the location of the Shrine of Sands.{#Name="Accord"}
But the path that would take her there was{LF}a blistering hell that punished all trespassers...{#Name="Accord"}
Stay in the shade to recover your strength!{#Name="Decadus"}
暑すぎる！　クソ！　死ね！{#Name="ゼロ"}
このクソみたいな魔法を出したクソには、{LF}クソみたいに死んでもらうからな……{#Name="ゼロ"}
イチイチイチイチ面倒な事しやがって……{#Name="ゼロ"}
またか……{#Name="ゼロ"}
