So this Three chick is another sister of yours?{#Name="Dito"}
Unfortunately.{#Name="Zero"}
Was she this weird when she was young?{LF}Or is that a new thing?{#Name="Dito"}
No idea. Not my problem.{#Name="Zero"}
Wow. Now I actually feel sorry for her.{#Name="Dito"}
You know, we haven't seen much of each other lately.{LF}Don't you...miss me?{#Name="Dito"}
......{#Name="Decadus"}
Hello?{#Name="Zero"}
Oh! My apologies, my lady! I did not mean to ignore you.{#Name="Decadus"}
What were you fantasizing about this time?{#Name="Zero"}
N-Nothing, my lady. Just...thinking about Lady Four. {#Name="Decadus"}
Oh? You care enough to remember her, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
Worry not, my lady. My heart is yours alone.{#Name="Decadus"}
She was acting pretty weird, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
I assume you mean Lady Three?{#Name="Octa"}
To be honest, I'm not sure.{LF}She always was a bit of an odd duck.{#Name="Octa"}
Though one thing did pique my curiosity...{#Name="Octa"}
What's that?{#Name="Zero"}
Normally, my love truncheon would rise{LF}to attention at the sight of Lady Three.{#Name="Octa"}
But when I beheld her this time, it didn't stir an inch!{#Name="Octa"}
My hat is off to you, Lady Zero,{LF}for taming a lust as voracious as mine!{#Name="Octa"}
Is that a compliment?{#Name="Zero"}
In any case, Lady Three did leave us with{LF}some rather important words, mmm?{#Name="Octa"}
You're awfully quiet. What's wrong?{#Name="Zero"}
Two... Something about that name bothers me.{#Name="Cent"}
I often pay scant attention to others.{LF}But something about this Two person just...{#Name="Cent"}
Is it really that much of a mystery?{#Name="Zero"}
You and Two are supposed to be working together,{LF}after all.{#Name="Zero"}
Me? Two? Working? Together?{#Name="Cent"}
Forget it. It's a moot point now, anyway.{#Name="Zero"}
Two. Twoooooo...{#Name="Cent"}
I sure wish I could be stronger, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
You and me both.{#Name="Zero"}
Do you think I'll ever grow a flower in my eye?{LF}Huh? Do you?{#Name="Mikhail"}
If I had one, I could make it sprout up and blossom,{LF}and then boooooom!{#Name="Mikhail"}
This flower ain't all sunshine and lollipops, ya know.{#Name="Zero"}
And you can't just make it "sprout up," either.{#Name="Zero"}
First, you need another person to pay for—{#Name="Zero"}
Ah, forget it.{#Name="Zero"}
Aw, come on! You can't trail off there!{#Name="Mikhail"}
That's mean. You're mean, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
I just wanna be a big, strong dragon!{LF}That's all I want!{#Name="Mikhail"}
So what next?{#Name="Zero"}
I think Three's right. One might be hiding{LF}somewhere deeper in the forest.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Ugh. I'm so tired of walking through these stupid woods!{#Name="Dito"}
Well, turning back is just as much of a trek,{LF}so we might as well keep going.{#Name="Octa"}
Octa speaks the truth. Whether One is here or not,{LF}we should press on.{#Name="Decadus"}
All right then. Hop to it. {#Name="Zero"}
