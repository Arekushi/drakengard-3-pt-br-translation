Reveal the truth of it all.{#Name="説明文"}
Well, well. Glad to see you're finally interested in hearing me out.{#Name="Accord"}
Yeah.{#Name="Zero"}
Though, you could sound a bit more thankful, at least...{#Name="Accord"}
Just start talking before I tear you apart.{#Name="Zero"}
Oooh, scary!{#Name="Accord"}
Fine, fine. Listen up.{#Name="Accord"}
For starters, let's talk about your sisters, shall we?{#Name="Accord"}
You know? The accursed sisters that you're destined to fight?{#Name="Accord"}
Then we should talk about how much time you've got left.{#Name="Accord"}
August the 21st, 998 A.D.{#Name=" "}
The first time I saw this flower...{#Name="Zero"}
was the day I died.{#Name="Zero"}
...Now I'm just a corpse being kept{LF}alive by the flower's magic.{#Name="Zero"}
...A corpse.{#Name="Zero"}
My brain, my heart, my body—{#Name="Zero"}
it's all being kept in motion by the flower.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm no longer alive in any real sense of the word.{#Name="Zero"}
This flower is a calamity that{LF}threatens the entire world.{#Name="Zero"}
It's growing. Feeding off me.{#Name="Zero"}
Eventually, it's going to consume me entirely,{#Name="Zero"}
and once that happens? Once it's fully grown?{#Name="Zero"}
...It's going to destroy everything.{#Name="Zero"}
Heh. Pretty shit deal, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
When I realized I was infected by a flower{LF}that was going to end the world...{#Name="Zero"}
I tried to kill myself.{#Name="Zero"}
Well, technically I was already dead, but...yeah. {#Name="Zero"}
Anyway...{#Name="Zero"}
I tried to rip the damn thing out, but...{#Name="Zero"}
in the end, that just made things worse.{#Name="Zero"}
The flower freaked out.{LF}Started sprouting these...children.{#Name="Zero"}
Five little girls, one after the other.{#Name="Zero"}
They burst out of me and ran{LF}off before I could blink.{#Name="Zero"}
Basically...{#Name="Zero"}
To prevent me from killing it,{LF}the flower made copies of me.{#Name="Zero"}
And that's how I ended up with my sisters.{#Name="Zero"}
Course, these "children" aren't{LF}any more alive than I am.{#Name="Zero"}
So now...{#Name="Zero"}
The eldest corpse is running around{LF}killing all of its little corpse sisters.{#Name="Zero"}
...Heh. Insane, isn't it?{#Name="Zero"}
My sisters took everything from me.{#Name="Zero"}
They each ran off with a piece of my magic.{#Name="Zero"}
...Or the flower's magic, I guess.{#Name="Zero"}
At first I tried to recapture 'em, but...{#Name="Zero"}
They had all my power, and I had...nothing.{#Name="Zero"}
But you wanna know the best part?{#Name="Zero"}
After a while, my sisters started{LF}fighting for "peace."{#Name="Zero"}
They come from a flower that's gonna end{LF}the world, and they fight for PEACE?{#Name="Zero"}
...Hilarious.{#Name="Zero"}
Anyway, that's when I made my choice:{#Name="Zero"}
I decided to kill my sisters...{#Name="Zero"}
and then destroy the flower.{#Name="Zero"}
I figured I started this whole mess, ya know?{#Name="Zero"}
I might as well finish it.{#Name="Zero"}
So that's about the long and short of it.{#Name="Zero"}
That's what this whole thing's about.{#Name="Zero"}
Michael!{#Name="Zero"}
I can hear you. There's no need to shout.{#Name="Michael"}
As I searched for a way to kill my sisters,{#Name="Zero"}
I learned there was only one option.{#Name="Zero"}
If I wanted to put 'em in the ground for good,{#Name="Zero"}
I was going to need a dragon.{#Name="Zero"}
See, to break the flower's magic,{#Name="Zero"}
only a dragon, or a weapon made{LF}from a dragon, will do the trick.{#Name="Zero"}
So I joined up with Michael,{LF}the strongest dragon of them all.{#Name="Zero"}
And the two of us worked together.{#Name="Zero"}
Zero.{#Name="Michael"}
Yeah?{#Name="Zero"}
Are you certain about this?{#Name="Michael"}
What's wrong, Michael? You scared?{#Name="Zero"}
Bah. I fear nothing!{#Name="Michael"}
Heh heh heh.{#Name="Zero"}
A dragon who reneges on his word?{LF}That'd be somethin'.{#Name="Zero"}
I would never sully myself so!{#Name="Michael"}
Then you know what to do.{#Name="Zero"}
Once all my sisters are dead...{#Name="Zero"}
you have to kill me too. Deal?{#Name="Zero"}
...Agreed.{#Name="Michael"}
