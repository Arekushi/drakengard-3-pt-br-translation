Are you okay, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah, I'm fine.{#Name="Zero"}
These soldier maggots just piss me off, is all.{#Name="Zero"}
Maggots? Hey, do you like maggots, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
What kind of question is that? Of course not.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh. I thought maybe you had some.{LF}I'm kinda hungry...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Don't eat maggots, dummy!{#Name="Zero"}
I'm getting kinda tired...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Stop whining.{#Name="Zero"}
Hey, flying is pretty hard, okay?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Stop complaining.{#Name="Zero"}
I mean...uh...it's fun! So fun! Wheee!{#Name="Mikhail"}
You can stop lying, too.{#Name="Zero"}

Dieee!{#Name="Soldier B"}
That's my line, shitface!{#Name="Zero"}
You're mine, demon! Mine!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Shouldn't you be suckling on Mommy's teat right now?{#Name="Zero"}
You're not coming anywhere near Lady Five!{#Name="Soldier A"}
"Lady Five, Lady Five!"{LF}...Pathetic.{#Name="Zero"}
Just die, would you?{#Name="Zero"}
I'll give you something to cry about!{#Name="Soldier F"}

臭っ！近寄るな、馬鹿{#Name="ゼロ"}
えっ。ボク臭い？{#Name="ミハイル"}
臭いヤツほど自分のにおいに鈍感なんだ{#Name="ゼロ"}
Hey, Zero? What do I smell like?{#Name="Mikhail"}
A bloated goat carcass stuffed with rotting fish.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh! That...doesn't sound good at all.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah. Now imagine having to ride on that thing.{#Name="Zero"}
Tee hee! I bet it's fun.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I'm sorry I smell like fish...{LF}But we ARE fighting out at sea.{#Name="Mikhail"}
You're not screwing around in the water, are you?{#Name="Zero"}
M-Me!? I, uh...no way! No! No...{#Name="Mikhail"}
If you're lying, I'm gonna kick your ass.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm sorry...{#Name="Mikhail"}
また上がってきた！{#Name="ミハイル"}
Where are you, Five?{#Name="Zero"}
You still haven't sunk that thing yet?{#Name="Zero"}
Hey, it's hard, okay? It's a giant battleship!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Can you help me out, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Fine, fine.{#Name="Zero"}
キミのその臭い背中にのってやるよ{#Name="ゼロ"}
ありがとう！今度、背中に香水つけとくね{#Name="ミハイル"}
やめろ。臭さが増すだけだ{#Name="ゼロ"}
デカイだけの軍艦なんて物の数じゃない{#Name="ゼロ"}
がんばってね！{#Name="ミハイル"}
一緒に倒すんだよ{#Name="ゼロ"}
All right. Let's take care of business.{#Name="Zero"}
Right!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Having you on my back makes me{LF}feel a lot stronger, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's your imagination. But you better{LF}get stronger for real soon, or else!{#Name="Zero"}
O-Okay...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Just fly where I tell you and shut up, all right?{#Name="Zero"}
Okay! Um...{#Name="Mikhail"}
What?{#Name="Zero"}
Well, I never really learned left from right,{LF}sooo...{#Name="Mikhail"}
You've got to be kidding me.{#Name="Zero"}
You haven't damaged this thing at all, have you?{#Name="Zero"}
I was saving it for you, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
For me?{#Name="Zero"}
Yeah! 'Cause I knew you'd love blowing it up!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Grr...{#Name="Zero"}
Just my little random act of kindness. Neat, huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Goddammit, dragon!{#Name="Zero"}
Ow, ow, ow! Why'd you just STAB ME!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Damn. This is tough.{#Name="Zero"}
SEE!? Battleships are actually super strong!{#Name="Mikhail"}
They can't be stronger than a dragon.{#Name="Zero"}
Er...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Come on! Come on!{#Name="Mikhail"}
You're flying too slow, dummy!{#Name="Zero"}
I'm trying, Zero! I'm really trying!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Well, try harder.{#Name="Zero"}
I want results, not excuses.{#Name="Zero"}
Once we sink this thing, we get to see Five, huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yep. Then the real fireworks start.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, yay! Fireworks are the best!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Idiot...{#Name="Zero"}
Look out!{#Name="Zero"}
Whew! That was a close one!{LF}Did you see it? Did you?{#Name="Mikhail"}
That wasn't CLOSE! It was a direct hit!{#Name="Zero"}
Hey, I'm trying pretty hard for you, aren't I?{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's okay to praise me sometimes.{LF}Maybe tell me how good I'm doing?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Shut up, dumbass!{#Name="Zero"}
That's not exactly what I had in mind...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Faster! Higher! Keep flying!{#Name="Zero"}
It's haaaaaard!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hard? A real dragon could do this in his sleep.{#Name="Zero"}
Hey, you're comparing me to Michael again,{LF}aren't you?{#Name="Mikhail"}
I would never do that.{#Name="Zero"}
Really?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yes, really. Because Michael was amazing,{LF}and you're a big dummy.{#Name="Zero"}
I wish you'd use my name like you use his...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Well, you just watch. I'm gonna fight real{LF}hard so you HAVE to use my name!{#Name="Mikhail"}
There it is. Five is in that shrine.{#Name="Zero"}
Her dragon's not with her!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Now's our chance to put her in the ground!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Look at her! The Intoner's drenched in blood!{#Name="Soldier C"}
The traitor Zero must be eliminated!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Indeed! It's time to show her the power of our united forces!{#Name="Soldier F"}
I'll kill you... I'll kill you... I'LL KILL YOU!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Calm down, idiot!{#Name="Soldier A"}
It pains me to think how frightened Lady Five must be right now...{#Name="Soldier B"}
Don't worry. She's got Dito with her.{#Name="Soldier E"}
That's why it pains me!{#Name="Soldier B"}
How can our Intoner abide him? It makes no sense!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Well...this is the end...{#Name="Soldier F"}
Don't give up yet!{#Name="Soldier G"}
I'm here with you. Let's keep going!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Where does her strength come from?{#Name="Soldier A"}
She fights like a woman possessed.{#Name="Soldier C"}
She's no woman... She's a demon!{#Name="Soldier A"}
She'd be super hot if she wasn't trying to kill us...{#Name="Soldier C"}
No kidding. What a shame!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Where's the dragon?{#Name="Soldier E"}
Nowhere to be found.{#Name="Soldier D"}
I'm ready to do this!{#Name="Soldier D"}
She...she's made it this far...?{#Name="Soldier A"}
This ends here!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Where did her dragon go!?{#Name="Soldier C"}
She's coming this way!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Lady Five! Protect me!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Savage girl! You'll have to strike this old man down first!{#Name="Soldier F"}
I'm not afraid... I'm not afraid!{#Name="Soldier G"}
目標達成　敵兵士を撃破した！{#Name="説明文"}
こんな所に閉じ込めやがって……{#Name="ゼロ"}
ふっ……ふふふっ{#Name="ゼロ"}
ゼロ！？どうしたの？大丈夫！？{#Name="ミハイル"}
いや、逆に楽しくなってきたよ{#Name="ゼロ"}
楽しい？どうして？{#Name="ミハイル"}
これだけ鬱陶しい想いをさせてもらったんだ{#Name="ゼロ"}
後から{LF}ファイブをブチ殺す楽しみが増えてしょうがないよ{#Name="ゼロ"}
うん！楽しいのがふえるのはいいことだね！{#Name="ミハイル"}
Aaaaaah!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Look out! Friendly fire!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Hold your ground! For Lady Five's sake!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Well, aren't you the brave one?{#Name="Zero"}
That cannon fire's annoying, though.{LF}Better keep moving.{#Name="Zero"}
