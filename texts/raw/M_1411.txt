It's Zero! She's here!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Shit! Everybody run!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Don't retreat, fool! Fight her! Fight her now!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Advance! Advaaance!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Dammit! We can't hold her!{#Name="Soldier B"}
An Intoner that can summon dragons!?{#Name="Soldier C"}
That flower is freaking me out, man!{#Name="Soldier D"}
She's too fast for us!{#Name="Soldier E"}
We're being punished! This is divine punishment!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Damn! She's mowing us down like flies!{#Name="Soldier G"}
It's Zero! The Intoner! ...And her DRAGON!{#Name="Soldier A"}
THAT'S Zero!?{#Name="Soldier D"}
Keep your eyes forward!{#Name="Soldier E"}
That...that's just...{#Name="Soldier G"}
We must lay down our lives to stop the accursed Intoner!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Yeahhh!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Ah, the pain! The paaain!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Someone, anyone help me!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Give me a hand! He's not gonna make it!{#Name="Soldier E"}
It's no different over here!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Medics! Where the hell are the medics!?{#Name="Soldier G"}
Help me! Please, help meeee!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Quit your whining!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Hold nothing back! Charge! Go, go, go!{#Name="Soldier B"}
You won't be forgiven, traitorous Intoner!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Was Zero's eye always like that!?{#Name="Soldier C"}
Don't get careless or you'll lose your head!{#Name="Soldier D"}
April the 20th, 1000 A.D.{#Name="Accord"}
The Land of Seas.{#Name="Accord"}
Come on, you big son of a bitch!{#Name="Zero"}
私と戦うなんて百年早いんでないぃいッ？{#Name="セント"}
ここで一汗流した後はゼロ様と……ふほほほっ{#Name="オクタ"}
寄るなよ！　死ねッ！　死ねッ！{LF}醜いヤツは大嫌いだッ！{#Name="ディト"}
この……苦しみも……痛みも……私の望みッ{#Name="デカート"}
Ah, the sea is certainly lovely, isn't it?{#Name="Octa"}
Indeed!{#Name="Decadus"}
Seriously? You guys are crazy.{#Name="Dito"}
It's just a big blue blob.{LF}And it smells like fish shit.{#Name="Dito"}
Seriously? You guys are crazy.{#Name="Dito"}
It's just a big blue blob.{LF}And it smells like fish shit.{#Name="Dito"}
I'll go attack the ships!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey, get your shit together!{LF}We're taking fire here!{#Name="Zero"}
I'm trying, I'm trying!{LF}I'm trying really, really hard!{#Name="Mikhail"}
145{#Name="ゼロ"}
Um, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
What now?{#Name="Zero"}
Can I go find a bush? I need to pee.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Just hold it, dummy! Or else piss from up there.{#Name="Zero"}
What!? I can't do that!{LF}That's what animals do and stuff!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Woo-hoo! I sunk that ship!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Great.{#Name="Zero"}
Hey, I did it all by myself! C'mon, Zero,{LF}you can praise me a little!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Maybe next time...IF you don't piss yourself.{#Name="Zero"}
Yay!{#Name="Mikhail"}
An ambush, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
Oh ho! This is a wretched homecoming indeed!{#Name="Octa"}
You know we're going through all{LF}this crap for you, Zero, right?{#Name="Dito"}
...Riiight!?{#Name="Dito"}
What are you going on about?{#Name="Zero"}
Goodness, Lady Zero! You certainly{LF}can be dense sometimes!{#Name="Cent"}
It's hardly befitting your grand{LF}status as an Intoner.{#Name="Cent"}
Look, all I'm saying is, a little thank-you{LF}might be nice.{#Name="Dito"}
Not that we'd ask for money or anything{LF}so crass from an Intoner!{#Name="Cent"}
Let's see... I know! How about{LF}a nice, home-cooked meal?{#Name="Cent"}
Ah, how lovely!{#Name="Octa"}
Great. It's settled, then.{#Name="Dito"}
Zero's home-cooked food... What an honor!{#Name="Decadus"}
I didn't agree to that.{#Name="Zero"}
Whatcha gonna make, Z? I could go for stew.{LF}Or anything boiled, really.{#Name="Dito"}
I prefer organic dishes with locally{LF}sourced ingredients.{#Name="Cent"}
I'm rather fond of sweets.{#Name="Decadus"}
I'll take anything that doubles as an aphrodisiac!{#Name="Octa"}
That sounds like the last thing YOU need.{#Name="Zero"}
So, back to what we were discussing earlier...{#Name="Dito"}
I actually think stew is my favorite meal. {#Name="Dito"}
Yes, though a nice piece of fish carpaccio{LF}would be lovely.{#Name="Cent"}
Maybe with some tapenade on the side{LF}and a chilled Chablis?{#Name="Cent"}
Or you can just soak bread in eggs and sugar.{#Name="Decadus"}
Cook it up, add honey and cream?{LF}...Delicious!{#Name="Decadus"}
I've heard that soup made from the fresh blood{LF}of a rare beast will raise one's spirits all night!{#Name="Octa"}
I'll just have what you always give me, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey, yeah. What does she feed you anyway?{#Name="Dito"}
Um, let's see... Rare meat cut into chunks...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Overcooked soup that tastes like metal...{#Name="Mikhail"}
A bunch of moldy, bitter leaves...{#Name="Mikhail"}
This fatty blob I can chew and{LF}chew and it won't go away...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Stop! Just stop! I'm about to hurl over here.{#Name="Dito"}
Is that the sort of thing a dragon usually eats?{#Name="Decadus"}
No, but that's what Zero eats,{LF}so I just go along with it.{#Name="Mikhail"}
You guys want some?{#Name="Zero"}
No thanks!{#Name="Dito/Cent/Octa/Decadus"}
You guys stay here. I need to go look for something.{#Name="Zero"}
Accord... What did I tell you about barging in here!?{#Name="Zero"}
Huh? I could have sworn I knocked...{#Name="Accord"}
Oh well! Water under the bridge.{#Name="Accord"}
Lemme guess. You're here to give me some grim warning?{#Name="Zero"}
Yep!{#Name="Accord"}
As things stand now, it doesn't matter what{LF}branch you go down—it all ends in disaster.{#Name="Accord"}
Figured I'd give you a heads-up.{#Name="Accord"}
So how come you can see the future, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
I can't tell you that.{#Name="Accord"}
Or maybe...{#Name="Zero"}
Hmm?{#Name="Accord"}
Maybe you don't see the future at all.{#Name="Zero"}
Maybe you're the one who's making it. That would explain a lot.{#Name="Zero"}
Sorry, but I'm not that talented.{#Name="Accord"}
...I see.{#Name="Zero"}
Ooh, scary.{#Name="Accord"}
Well, until next time.{#Name="Accord"}
Hmph.{#Name="Zero"}
Defeat the enemies blocking your way!{#Name="説明文"}
Defeat the Gigas!{#Name="説明文"}
Defeat the Cannoneers!{#Name="説明文"}
Return to Zero's cottage.{#Name="説明文"}
So if Accord's telling the truth about this "branch" stuff...{#Name="Zero"}
Maybe there's a world where the flower doesn't appear.{#Name="Zero"}
There's gotta be a hint or something that can lead me there...{#Name="Zero"}
The arm I lost to One...{#Name="Zero"}
If that's when the branch occurred, I'm already too late.{#Name="Zero"}
181{#Name="ゼロ"}
Could there really be a world without this flower?{#Name="Zero"}
I wonder what I'm like over there? Or what my sisters are like.{LF}...Do I even HAVE sisters?{#Name="Zero"}
Meh, no point dwelling on it.{#Name="Zero"}
127{#Name="ゼロ"}
Medicine...{#Name="Zero"}
I managed to survive, but at what cost?{#Name="Zero"}
My body is cursed now, and the stupid thing{LF}won't even let me die.{#Name="Zero"}
All those guys who call me the accursed Intoner{LF}are more right then they know.{#Name="Zero"}
217{#Name="ゼロ"}
If I'm the singularity Accord was talking about,{#Name="Zero"}
then maybe I'm the one bringing this world to ruin.{#Name="Zero"}
163{#Name="ゼロ"}
I think it's time to talk to Accord face-to-face.{#Name="Zero"}
379{#Name="アコール"}

289{#Name="アコール"}
469{#Name="アコール"}
523{#Name="アコール"}
Weeell, ain't this a grand reception?{#Name="Zero"}
This land fell into chaos after Lady Five's death.{#Name="Decadus"}
Still, I'm surprised to see so much resistance.{#Name="Decadus"}
Zero! Lemme burn that up so you can get through!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Looks like we're here...{#Name="Zero"}
Finish your search and leave the cottage?{#Name=" "}

Sooo...if this is the end of this branch, then... Wait, what?{#Name="アコール"}
Oh, gosh, I didn't lose a recording by accident, did I?{#Name="アコール"}
And what happened to the branches between A and C?{#Name="アコール"}
Ugh. If I screw this up, I'm gonna be in soooo much trouble...{#Name="アコール"}
Okay, just breathe. Whew! For starters, let's check out recording M1410_E0002_FL...{#Name="アコール"}
