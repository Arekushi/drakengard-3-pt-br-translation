This forest is horrifying. No sane{LF}person could ever live here.{#Name="Decadus"}
Mmm? I don't mind it so much.{#Name="Cent"}
He said SANE person, Cent.{LF}That means not you.{#Name="Dito"}
He said SANE person, Cent.{LF}That means not you.{#Name="Dito"}
Five? I thought I killed you.{#Name="Zero"}
You dumbass. You resurrected yourself?{#Name="Zero"}
Arise...Galgaliel.{#Name="Five"}
{06}>{#Name="Dito"}
Oh, Five! You're looking better than ever now!{#Name="Dito"}
This is exactly the kind of insane world I've always wanted!{#Name="Dito"}
It's just perfect for an undesirable sap like me!{LF}I think I'm gonna stay here FOREVER!{#Name="Dito"}
I love this new you, Five.{LF}You can do whatever you want to me. Anything at all.{#Name="Dito"}
Hey, Z...{#Name="Dito"}
Looks like your number's up!{#Name="Dito"}
Phanuel, arise!{#Name="Dito"}
Egregori, dance!{#Name="Cent"}
I can handle these guys...{LF}Maybe you can take care of Five?{#Name="Cent"}
What's Five doing here in the{LF}forest instead of Three?{#Name="Zero"}
Perhaps Accord was right about{LF}the world breaking down.{#Name="Octa"}
Oh, for fuck's sake.{#Name="Zero"}
This is great! Oh my gosh,{LF}this place is freaking great!{#Name="Dito"}
Look at it, Cent! It's amazing!{LF}There's blood and guts and...everything!{#Name="Dito"}
It's a world where only ugly is beautiful!{#Name="Dito"}
And a world where idiots are geniuses!{LF}So join me, Cent!{#Name="Dito"}
Meeeeee?{#Name="Cent"}
Yeah! You! Come on, I know you{LF}hate the world you're in.{#Name="Dito"}
I've known it forever!{LF}It's written all over your face!{#Name="Dito"}
Mmmm? That obvious, is it?{#Name="Cent"}
Well, I suppooose that might be the case.{#Name="Cent"}
But even if I were to join you in that world...{#Name="Cent"}
It wouldn't revive Lady Two.{#Name="Cent"}
Huh?{#Name="Dito"}
My place was by her side.{LF}It's really all I ever had...{#Name="Cent"}
Ugh, what the hell, man?{LF}You sound like a lovesick teenager.{#Name="Dito"}

ゼゼゼゼゼ……ゼ……ロ……お姉様……すすすすすすす……て……きき{#Name="ファイブ"}
How did a beauty like Five ever{LF}end up in such a sad state?{#Name="Octa"}
I'm guessing the flower's force{LF}willed her body back to life.{#Name="Zero"}
But neither one could handle the other,{LF}so now we have this.{#Name="Zero"}
Stupid bastard should have just stayed dead.{#Name="Zero"}
A sad sight indeed...{#Name="Octa"}
She seems to be in pain... I'd be glad{LF}to ease it with my staff of miracles!{#Name="Octa"}
やめておけ。アイツは昔から快感のわからない女なんだ{#Name="ゼロ"}
Of all the sisters, the flower's grip{LF}on Zero is by far the strongest.{#Name="Octa"}
I fear she, too, will be consumed...{#Name="Octa"}
Hm? What's that?{#Name="Zero"}
...Nothing, my lady.{#Name="Octa"}
Z-Zero... Beauti...ful Zero...{#Name="Five"}
{06}>{#Name="Five"}
See ya in hell,{#Name="Zero"}
Sister.{#Name="163"}
Huh? Wait, what the hell is this!?{#Name="Dito"}
You summoned an angel without the aid of an Intoner.{#Name="Zero"}
Gonna have to pay for it somehow.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, come on! That's not even fair!{#Name="Dito"}
I finally found it!{#Name="Dito"}
I finally found a world I can live in and truly love!{#Name="Dito"}
Zero, wait. No! No no no no no no no—{#Name="Dito"}
Cent...{#Name="Zero"}
So that's how it is, huh?{#Name="Cent"}
I honestly had no idea.{#Name="Cent"}
I am just an idiot, after all, right?{#Name="Cent"}
Oh well.{#Name="Cent"}
There's no point in living in a world without Lady Two anyway. Now I can rest.{#Name="Cent"}

Make your way through this cursed forest.{#Name="説明文"}
I need backup here! Give me sound and time!{#Name="Soldier D"}
S-Sound? And time? I don't understand!{#Name="Soldier F"}
It seems they still have partial{LF}control of themselves...{#Name="Octa"}
Wait. They don't even realize they're dead!?{#Name="Dito"}
Ha ha ha! That's so awesome,{LF}I can't stand it!{#Name="Dito"}
{06}>{#Name="Five"}
S...st... Stop...ppp...{#Name="Five"}
