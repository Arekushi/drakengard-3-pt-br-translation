That was mean, Zero! That was mean!{#Name="Mikhail"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
You can whine at me later.{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Octa"}
Three...{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
Hmm...? Zero?{#Name="Three"}
Lady Three.{#Name="Octa"}
Octa.{#Name="Three"}
Please. Let's put an end to this here.{#Name="Octa"}
...I don't understand.{#Name="Three"}
What are you doing over there?{#Name="Three"}
I betrayed you.{#Name="Octa"}
Is that so.{#Name="Three"}
{06}>{#Name="Three"}
In any case...{#Name="Three"}
You might want to pay a little more attention to your surroundings, hmm?{#Name="Three"}
Octa.{#Name="Three"}
Yes, my lady?{#Name="Octa"}
Why did you betray me?{#Name="Three"}
Because I had grown weary of your conduct, my lady.{#Name="Octa"}
The way you experimented on people...{#Name="Octa"}
The way you ruthlessly toyed with their lives...{#Name="Octa"}
I simply could not abide it any longer.{#Name="Octa"}
Your recreational activities{LF}drove me away, my lady.{#Name="Octa"}
Hmmm...{#Name="Three"}
So this is your final decision, Octa?{#Name="Three"}
It is. I serve Lady Zero in all things now.{#Name="Octa"}
You don't say.{#Name="Three"}
My lady, you must put an end to these atrocities—{#Name="Octa"}
{06}>{#Name="Octa"}
You seem to be somewhat confused, Octa.{#Name="Three"}
A disciple doesn't choose his Intoner.{#Name="Three"}
An Intoner chooses her disciple.{#Name="Three"}
{06}>{#Name="Octa"}
{06}>{#Name="Octa"}
{06}>{#Name="Three"}
{06}>{#Name="Three"}
D-Damn you...{#Name="Octa"}
Can't...stop...{#Name="Octa"}
B-Behold the third song:{#Name="Octa"}
Quickened Puppets of Antiquity!{#Name="Octa"}
The raging demon's deathly gaze...{#Name="Octa"}
The army of heretics that rejects the natural cycle...{#Name="Octa"}
Render into ash the powers of reason and order!{#Name="Octa"}
I, Octa...summon thee in my name...{#Name="Octa"}
Armisael, invade!{#Name="Octa"}
Zero, that was wonderf—{#Name="Three"}
{06}>{#Name="Three"}
Did you really think...something like that...would finish an Intoner...?{#Name="Three"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
What the...{#Name="Zero"}
Did he really just do that?{#Name="Dito"}
The dragon shows his true colors...{#Name="Decadus"}
Is this what dragons are—{#Name="Octa"}
{06}>{#Name="Dito"}
{06}>{#Name="Decadus"}
{06}>{#Name="Octa"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
Oh! Well, hello there.{#Name="? ? ?"}
So my name's Cent,{#Name="? ? ?"}
and I was "sent" here by Lady Two.{#Name="Cent"}
I've come to take this horrid dragon off your hands.{#Name="Cent"}
W-Wait...{#Name="Zero"}
145{#Name="145"}
Ooh, sorry. Out of time.{#Name="Cent"}
I'm kind of a busy guy, see?{#Name="Cent"}
In fact, I only had eight hours of sleep last night!{#Name="Cent"}
If I weren't as powerful as I am...{#Name="Cent"}
I'd likely be dead by now.{#Name="Cent"}
And that would be a shame of epic proportions.{#Name="Cent"}
Oh, but listen to me go on!{#Name="Cent"}
I'm going to be late, and then Lady Two might get angry.{#Name="Cent"}
Not that I'm scared of her or anything. Oh no, nothing like that.{#Name="Cent"}
Wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea about me.{#Name="Cent"}
Anyway.{#Name="Cent"}
Gotta go, kids. Ta-ta for now!{#Name="Cent"}
Mik...hail...{#Name="Zero"}
145{#Name="145"}
Mikhail...{#Name="Zero"}
73{#Name="73"}
Mikhail!{#Name="Zero"}
Zerooo! Help meeeeee!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Goddammit. What now?{#Name="Zero"}
Free Mikhail.{#Name="説明文"}
Defeat the Enhanced Soldiers!{#Name="説明文"}
Defeat the army of Armisael!{#Name="説明文"}
Kill Three.{#Name="目的文"}
What? How the hell did they make it this far!?{#Name="Soldier F"}
Look! Octa himself is with them!{#Name="Soldier E"}
All men, take position! Repeat, all men, take position!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Look! It's the accursed songstress's slaves of the night!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Actually, they're disciples?{#Name="Soldier D"}
It's the same thing, you idiot!{#Name="Soldier C"}
I...I will protect Lady Three to the very end!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Well said, kid! You do that! I'm...just gonna let you take the lead, then...{#Name="Soldier B"}
Keep your eyes on the ground.{#Name="Zero"}
Yes, we don't want to stumble here.{#Name="Decadus"}
It's not that. Looking at that{LF}dummy just pisses me off.{#Name="Zero"}
That big baby of yours sure{LF}does get tied up a lot.{#Name="Dito"}
If Lady Three catches him, she{LF}may experiment on his body.{#Name="Octa"}
B-Body experiments? Ungh... That would{LF}be delectib... Er, I mean...detestable...{#Name="Decadus"}
Sorry I messed up again, Zero. I'll be better...{#Name="Mikhail"}
You're awfully reserved.{#Name="Zero"}
Huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
You're not going "Aww!" or "I tried super hard!"{LF}or whatever.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, can I!? Hey, in that case, guess what?{LF}Guess what, huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Shut it, dummy. The ivy's just gonna dig{LF}deeper into you. Hold still and be quiet{LF}until I can cut you down.{#Name="Zero"}
I don't think you're telling the truth.{#Name="Three"}
My lady, I—{#Name="Octa"}
You left because your lust needed{LF}a more eager partner.{#Name="Three"}
Your limitless desire no longer{LF}caused my honey to flow...{#Name="Three"}
And so you grew restless.{#Name="Three"}
That's... Well, it may have been a reason, but...{#Name="Octa"}
So tell me, Three...{LF}What does make the old honey flow these days?{#Name="Zero"}
Hmm?{#Name="Three"}
Oh, please. Don't play dumb with me.{LF}I know you have desires.{#Name="Zero"}
I...{#Name="Three"}
I no longer hold any love for my disciple.{LF}My love is reserved for my soldiers now.{#Name="Three"}
My sweet, beloved little soldiers.{#Name="Three"}
You must flee at once!{LF}We cannot stop Lady Three now!{#Name="Octa"}
Pfft! I'm not scared of some whack-job loser{LF}who hides in her room making dolls all day.{#Name="Zero"}
They're not dolls, my lady.{LF}They're soldiers she's operated on!{#Name="Octa"}
Wh-What?{#Name="Decadus"}
Oh, that's terrible. ...I LOVE IT!{#Name="Dito"}
Zero! Hey! Listen!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hush. I'm in the middle of something right now.{#Name="Zero"}
Me too! I'm in the middle of something!{LF}Something weird!{#Name="Mikhail"}
What is it?{#Name="Zero"}
Whenever I look at Three, it's like...{LF}like, my body gets all hot...{#Name="Mikhail"}
There's this weird pain in my chest and tummy,{LF}and I start to get all tingly...{#Name="Mikhail"}
What should I do, Zero? Am I sick?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah, it's called "love." Probably terminal.{#Name="Zero"}
No, Zero! It's not like that! This is serious!{LF}It's... It's more like...{#Name="Mikhail"}
ミハ……イル{#Name="ゼロ"}
ミハイル……{#Name="ゼロ"}
……ミハイル！！{#Name="ゼロ"}
Ow! Zero, these guys explode!{LF}They explode all over you!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Pay attention! Don't let 'em latch on to you!{#Name="Zero"}
If the pain's that bad, shake 'em off!{#Name="Zero"}
Aaah! Their heads came off! They came off!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Good! Now crush those bastards!{#Name="Zero"}
That attack looks like it uses up a lot of power.{LF}Wait for an opening and then strike!{#Name="Zero"}
Wait for an opening and then strike!{#Name="Zero"}
Zerooo! It's too small for me to fly in here!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Ughhh! Piece of shit dragon...{#Name="Zero"}
