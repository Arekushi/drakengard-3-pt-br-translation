Wow. These skulls really class up the joint.{#Name="Zero"}
You're not scared, right, Zero?{LF}You're not scared of this?{#Name="Mikhail"}
No. You?{#Name="Zero"}
Nope! I'm not scared! Not one little bit!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Seems like you've gotten stronger.{#Name="Zero"}
Really!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey, stay focused! Eyes forward.{#Name="Zero"}
But, Zero! Do you really think{LF}I'm stronger now? Huh!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Maybe.{#Name="Zero"}
Awww...{#Name="Mikhail"}
But...I'd definitely be in trouble without you.{#Name="Zero"}
Huh? Wow! Hey, say that again! Pleeease!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Quit dancing around! You'll hurt yourself.{#Name="Zero"}
If all the Intoners die, the song that's{LF}driving your curse should, too.{#Name="Zero"}
Then this batshit world can try to repair itself.{#Name="Zero"}
You better be ready, One.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm coming for you!{#Name="Zero"}
This must be One's room.{#Name="Zero"}
Intoners offer only pestilence to this world.{#Name="One"}
Someday, they will be the disease that brings ruin to all human life.{#Name="One"}
That's why you're trying to kill us: to save the world.{#Name="One"}
And once you succeed in killing your sisters...{#Name="One"}
You're going to finish the job...and kill yourself.{#Name="One"}
And you'll use that dragon to do it.{#Name="One"}
Huh!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Well, you seem to know what's going on, don't you?{#Name="Zero"}
Uh...Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
What's she talking about?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Fortunately, I suppose, I came to the same conclusion.{#Name="One"}
This world has no place for us.{#Name="One"}
Great! Then you won't mind dying.{#Name="Zero"}
I know about your flower. I know it's behind all of this.{#Name="One"}
And I imagine it's not going to let you die{LF}until it succeeds in destroying the world.{#Name="One"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
So it's like this, right?{#Name="Zero"}
We're both prepared to die,{#Name="Zero"}
but since you don't trust me to off myself,{#Name="Zero"}
you're gonna try and kill me first.{#Name="Zero"}
Yes.{#Name="One"}
Funny. I was thinking the exact same thing, One.{#Name="Zero"}
Abdiel, sing for me.{#Name="One"}
We've both been rejected by the world.{LF}We both feel the same threat.{#Name="One"}
And yet, here we are, fated to{LF}kill each other in the end.{#Name="One"}
Yeah, destiny's a real bitch sometimes.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, Zero. Still trying to be the bad girl.{#Name="One"}
I never did like that side of you.{#Name="One"}
Pfft.{#Name="Zero"}
And yet, for some reason...{#Name="One"}
I felt like you and I might understand each other.{#Name="One"}
What would some offshoot creation know{LF}about understanding? Don't be an idiot.{#Name="Zero"}
A pity. {#Name="One"}
Truly a pity.{#Name="One"}
Look out!{#Name="Zero"}
You too, Zero! Don't let your hands get hot!{#Name="Mikhail"}
What?{#Name="Zero"}
Your hands usually feel nice and cool, Zero.{#Name="Mikhail"}
But sometimes they get real hot, too.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Usually that's when your heart is crying.{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's when you're lost and in trouble and...crying.{#Name="Mikhail"}
And right now, your hands are really hot.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Stop with the bullshit and kill that thing already!{#Name="Zero"}
Zero... I know you know this!{#Name="One"}
If you want to kill an Intoner,{#Name="One"}
you need the power of a dragon!{#Name="One"}
Fuck!{#Name="Zero"}
Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Go!{#Name="Zero"}
You did it! You actually—{#Name="Zero"}
Zero, I...{#Name="Mikhail"}
I messed up.{#Name="Mikhail"}
No...{#Name="Zero"}
Zerooooooooo!{#Name="One"}
Ooooooooone!{#Name="Zero"}
Mikhaaail!{#Name="Zero"}
If you think you're the only one suffering here,{#Name="One"}
you're out of your goddamn mind!{#Name="One"}
Two, Three, Four, Five...{#Name="One"}
You gave life to each and every one of them...{#Name="One"}
Then you went and killed them all!{LF}What did you expect?{#Name="One"}
Cursing the world...{#Name="One"}
Then saving the world...{#Name="One"}
You thought you could do everything by yourself?{LF}Well, THIS IS WHAT YOU FUCKING GET!{#Name="One"}
Ugh... You're the one who should be erased, Zero!{#Name="One"}
Shut up! Shut up, shut up, shut up, SHUT UP!{#Name="Zero"}
You killed Mikhail...{#Name="Zero"}
You killed Mikhaaail!{#Name="Zero"}
Because he was your sword, Zero!{#Name="One"}
You're a cursed Intoner!{LF}You're going to destroy the world!{#Name="One"}
No! I'm... I'm...{#Name="Zero"}
Diiiiiieeeeee!{#Name="One"}
Aaaaaahhh!{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="One"}
You're the...only one left...Zero...{#Name="One"}
{06}>{#Name="One"}
Where will you find a dragon...powerful enough to kill you...?{#Name="One"}
Mikhail...{#Name="Zero"}
199{#Name="199"}
If you're not here...then who's gonna kill me?{#Name="Zero"}
Stupid One... Who does she think I am?{#Name="Zero"}
Idiot.{#Name="Zero"}
I'll find a dragon somehow...{LF}There's...still time...{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Zero"}
Update{#Name="Accord"}
The Intoner Zero completed her objective.{#Name="Accord"}
However, the dragon Mikhail has died,{#Name="Accord"}
and Zero's mental health is in a rather alarming state.{#Name="Accord"}
I'm afraid there's little chance of finding a solution in this timeline.{#Name="Accord"}
As such, I recommend sealing off this branch.{#Name="Accord"}

Kill One.{#Name=" "}
There's gotta be a magic core controlling them!{#Name="Zero"}
I don't know what that means, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's probably hidden in their bodies.{LF}Try killing one of 'em!{#Name="Zero"}
Dammit! It's not him.{#Name="Zero"}
Here we go again...{#Name="Zero"}
Huhhh? How come no core came out?{#Name="Mikhail"}
No! Over there! That one's got it!{#Name="Zero"}
Hey, did you see which one the core went into?{#Name="Zero"}
Uh...maybe it's the right one? No, wait! Left?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Ah, fuck it! Just destroy 'em all!{#Name="Zero"}
Watch to see which guy has the core!{#Name="Zero"}
If you get it wrong, we have to start over!{#Name="Zero"}
Defeat Abdiel!{#Name=" "}
Defeat One!{#Name=" "}
I'm gonna hit my head if I fly around in here!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Maybe that'll smarten you up a bit!{#Name="Zero"}
That's mean, Zero! Look, I'm not flying in here! I'm not!{#Name="Mikhail"}
