Camping again?{#Name="Dito"}
Well, anything that gives me an opportunity{LF}to keep you warm...{#Name="Dito"}
Cram it, would you? The only one you're heating up{LF}with that kind of talk is yourself.{#Name="Zero"}
Besides, I bet all this cold is giving you serious shrinkage.{#Name="Zero"}
Tch!{#Name="Dito"}
Let's go back down already.{LF}Guys like me weren't built for the cold.{#Name="Dito"}
You're sure Four is up here, right?{#Name="Zero"}
Um, probably?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Probably isn't good enough.{#Name="Zero"}
You're the only one who can sense Intoners, remember?{#Name="Zero"}
I sure can! I'm starting to really get used to this feeling, too!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah, I bet it feels real good, too, huh?{#Name="Dito"}
Oh yeah! It makes me spasm with delight!{#Name="Mikhail"}
...Stop teaching him things, Dito.{#Name="Zero"}
Zero, I sleep and I sleep, and yet still I'm so tired...{#Name="Mikhail"}
All right. We're off.{#Name="Zero"}
You go in from up high, all right?{#Name="Zero"}
Laaame. Wish I could fly around like big baby there...{#Name="Dito"}
No you don't! The higher you go, the colder it gets!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Huh, fair enough. Guess we'll just have to blaze{LF}our own trail on the ground, huh, Z?{#Name="Dito"}
Diverted by false information regarding Four's whereabouts,{#Name="Accord"}
Zero found herself on the hunt once more.{#Name="Accord"}
Guided by the faint Intoner presence they detected,{#Name="Accord"}
the group narrowed their search to a snowcapped range in the mountains...{#Name="Accord"}
