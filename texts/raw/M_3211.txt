Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the deal{LF}with all this fog?{#Name="Dito"}
I'm telling you, something's weird{LF}about this forest.{#Name="Dito"}
Yes, but...{#Name="Decadus"}
But...what?{#Name="Dito"}
If you say "The discomfort is exquisite!"{LF}or some shit, I swear I'll cut your head off.{#Name="Dito"}
Unnngh...{#Name="Decadus"}
How about some trivia time! Did you know{LF}faeries purify the air by burping?{#Name="Cent"}
Oh? I had no idea.{#Name="Octa"}
Don't be impressed. He pulls all this{LF}shit out of his ass.{#Name="Zero"}
Tch. Come now. This forest is tainted because{LF}it lacks faeries. Don't you see it? Surely, I can't{LF}be the only one?{#Name="Cent"}
I really, really hate this guy.{#Name="Dito"}
Ho ho! It seems the enemy has an endless{LF}supply of low-level minions...{#Name="Octa"}
Ugh...{#Name="Decadus"}
Truly, Decadus? This turns you on as well?{#Name="Octa"}
No. Defeating such weak foes actually...{LF}displeases me.{#Name="Decadus"}
I hate this one- and two-at-a-time shit.{#Name="Zero"}
I wish they'd just rush me all at once{LF}and get it over with!{#Name="Zero"}
For once, Z, I think I actually agree with you.{#Name="Dito"}
...Which is pretty scary when you think about it.{#Name="Dito"}
You do love to provoke our fair Intoner, don't you?{#Name="Cent"}
Yeah, and I'm gonna love killing you even more!{#Name="Dito"}
Oh ho! Spirits are possessing these bodies!{#Name="Octa"}
Spirits are attracted to deceased human corpses.{#Name="Decadus"}
They claim the body and force it to battle{LF}the living.{#Name="Cent"}
That's some hobby.{#Name="Zero"}
Dead bodies make great disposable transport!{#Name="Dito"}
Not bad, for a big baby dragon!{#Name="Dito"}
That's right! I'm not bad! Not bad at all!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Zero! Did you call me, Zero!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah, I did. So move it!{#Name="Zero"}
Hee hee. You need me, huh? You need me!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Shut up and get to work already!{#Name="Zero"}
Yeah, something about this forest{LF}definitely feels off.{#Name="Dito"}
You think?{#Name="Zero"}
Well, it is filled with both spirits{LF}and the undead.{#Name="Octa"}
And it's a pain in the ass.{#Name="Zero"}
It's not just that. I'm thinkin' this fog{LF}might be...poison.{#Name="Dito"}
Poison, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
Eh. It's probably fine.{#Name="Zero"}
That's it? Really?{#Name="Dito"}
Battling spirits and the undead feels{LF}like something of a fool's errand.{#Name="Decadus"}
Yeah. Good attitude there.{#Name="Cent"}
But I suppose that's the best a grunt{LF}like you can hope for.{#Name="Cent"}
Grunt? I am a disciple, just the same as you!{#Name="Decadus"}
Heh. Yeah, no. {#Name="Cent"}
We may have the same title, but the{LF}similarity ends there.{#Name="Cent"}
I, for example, am amazing.{LF}While you are...less so.{#Name="Cent"}
Hey, Decadus. Try not to kill him, okay?{#Name="Dito"}
'Cause if anyone here is gonna kill him, it's ME.{#Name="Dito"}
God, again? It's the same damn pattern every time!{#Name="Zero"}
They do seem to enjoy entrapping their prey.{#Name="Octa"}
Did someone say entrapment play? Nnngh...{#Name="Decadus"}
Ugh, this is so annoying!{#Name="Zero"}
These necromancers are a bunch of{LF}******* ****less ****-rammers!{#Name="Zero"}
Hee hee! Perhaps our foes are entomologists{LF}out to find new insects for their collection!{#Name="Cent"}
......{#Name="Zero"}
......{#Name="Cent"}
You're an idiot. Is that what you were waiting for?{#Name="Zero"}
What the hell are these creepy things?{#Name="Zero"}
What a nice surprise! They say only those of{LF}pure heart can see these little guys, you know.{#Name="Cent"}
Stop talking and fight already!{#Name="Zero"}
Ugh, this is driving me crazy!{#Name="Zero"}
Persistent little bastards, aren't they?{#Name="Dito"}
Dammit! I'm sick and tired of playing with dolls!{#Name="Zero"}
Patience, my lady. 'Tis better to bend like a reed{LF}in the wind than to topple like an oak.{#Name="Decadus"}
What the hell are you talking about?{LF}You're starting to sound like Cent!{#Name="Zero"}
Arrrgh, I hate this! Hate it, hate it, hate it!{#Name="Zero"}
Oh ho! It appears my lady is unaccustomed{LF}to such tedious work.{#Name="Octa"}
I'm not used to any work.{#Name="Zero"}
Except killing.{#Name="Dito"}
Killing isn't work. It's like takin'{LF}a piss—it comes naturally.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh. Look who's here.{#Name="Three"}
It's Zero.{#Name="Three"}
Heya, Three.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm in a rush, so...{#Name="Zero"}
You ready to die?{#Name="Zero"}
I suppose. But...{#Name="Three"}
Something's wrong...with the forest...{#Name="Three"}
Can't you hear the voices? The crying?{#Name="Three"}
Our dear sister One holds the secret.{#Name="Three"}
Up ahead... Deeper in the forest...{#Name="Three"}
Why is Octa fighting for Zero?{#Name="Soldier A"}
It doesn't matter. Octa's our enemy now!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Where is Lady Three!?{#Name="Soldier C"}
I don't know! We lost contact with her a while ago!{#Name="Soldier D"}
Well, send another messenger!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Curse the traitorous Intoner!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Lady Three freed us from the oppressive rule of the past. We owe her our lives!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Reinforcements! Call for reinforcements!{#Name="Soldier G"}
There's something weird about this forest...{#Name="Soldier B"}
What's the deal with this fog?{#Name="Soldier B"}
We don't have time to worry about that now!{#Name="Soldier G"}
If we don't stop that dragon, it'll torch us AND the forest!{#Name="Soldier C"}
