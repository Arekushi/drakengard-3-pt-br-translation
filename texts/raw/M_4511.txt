The Land of Sands.{#Name="Accord"}
Is this what's been interfering{LF}with our mental link?{#Name="Zero"}
The magic from those four towers is{LF}making the interference stronger!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Guess we've no choice but to destroy 'em all.{#Name="Zero"}
Don't worry. We can do this, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
343{#Name="343"}
What're your disciples up to?{#Name="Mikhail"}
No idea. I let 'em go. They're useless right now.{#Name="Zero"}
...That's really mean, Zero.{#Name="Mikhail"}
What do you want? They'd be too heavy{LF}for you anyway.{#Name="Zero"}
Besides, you know how they are.{#Name="Zero"}
Probably out lazily hunting for food,{LF}not giving a damn about us.{#Name="Zero"}
Hunting, huh? I wonder if they'll bring{LF}back my favorite!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
You eat rotten meat, dummy.{LF}You don't have a favorite.{#Name="Zero"}
What!? That's mean!{LF}I do so have favorites, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Oh, you do, do you? Like what?{#Name="Zero"}
Liiike...rotten meat?{LF}And...um...almost-rotten meat?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Pffft.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm a good dragon, Zero!{LF}I'm not a picky eater!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Your palate's gotta be pretty screwed up{LF}to enjoy rotten meat the way you do.{#Name="Zero"}
My palate? Hey, what's wrong with my palate!?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Don't you like my palate, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Well, you're not exactly a gourmet.{#Name="Zero"}
What's a gourmet?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Um... Well, someone like Michael, I guess.{#Name="Zero"}
Michael was a gourmet with a good palate?{LF}Like how?{#Name="Mikhail"}
He was...particular. Got mad{LF}any time I changed his diet.{#Name="Zero"}
Wow...{#Name="Mikhail"}
And he'd only eat food that was perfectly fresh.{#Name="Zero"}
If it was overripe? Even a little? Forget it.{#Name="Zero"}
Even if he was hungry?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Oh yeah. He'd go days without eating if he had to.{#Name="Zero"}
Wow! Awesome!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Trust me. Awesome is not the{LF}word you're looking for.{#Name="Zero"}
It must be really hard to make{LF}food for a gourmet, huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Heh. You have no idea. If Michael didn't like{LF}something, he'd be sure to let me know about it.{#Name="Zero"}
But at least it helped make me a better cook.{#Name="Zero"}
So are you good now? Are you the best cook ever?{#Name="Mikhail"}
What do you care? You eat rotten meat, remember?{#Name="Zero"}
There's no point in even trying with you.{#Name="Zero"}
Aww, that's mean!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey, tell me more about Michael!{LF}Please, please, pleeease? I wanna know more!{#Name="Mikhail"}
I... I forgot the rest.{#Name="Zero"}
Awwwww!{#Name="Mikhail"}
I'll try to make my palate better for you, okay?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Huh?{#Name="Zero"}
I've gotta try extra hard if I wanna{LF}be strong like Michael!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Oh, right. Well, good luck with that.{#Name="Zero"}
But, you know it's fine if you're{LF}not a gourmet, right?{#Name="Zero"}
It is?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah. Then I can feed you any old slop I find{LF}lying around. That's way easier for me.{#Name="Zero"}
Aw, come on! That's just humiliating!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Huh. That's a pretty big word for you.{#Name="Zero"}
We did it!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Now we can go back! We can go back and see everyone again!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yeah. That's the last thing I need right now.{#Name="Zero"}
Huh? Don't you want to see everyone? You must!{#Name="Mikhail"}
No, actually. I don't.{#Name="Zero"}
I really don't.{#Name="Zero"}
