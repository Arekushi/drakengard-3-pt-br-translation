Alert! Alert! Octa has joined with the enemy!{#Name="Soldier A"}
A disciple betraying his own Intoner? Unthinkable!{#Name="Soldier B"}
It is true? Octa's our enemy now?{#Name="Soldier C"}
There must be a reason! Maybe he's actually a double-agent.{#Name="Soldier D"}
Hey, yeah... Yeah! That MUST be it!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Shit! I'm wounded!{#Name="Soldier E"}
It's all right—here, I'll prop you up. You're gonna be okay! We have to keep fighting!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Don't give up! If you do, it'll be over for sure!{#Name="Soldier F"}
A man needs a brave spirit to best a cursed Intoner. Give her all you've got!{#Name="Soldier B"}
It's hopeless. There's no way we can win. Even Octa's abandoned his post!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Never mind Octa! You're still here, aren't ya? Now get back in formation!{#Name="Soldier C"}
So Three sounds kinda messed up.{#Name="Dito"}
Oh ho ho. Not so much messed up as{LF}simply...odd.{#Name="Octa"}
True, she's unpredictable and armed with giant{LF}scissors. But when she gets aroused...grrawl!{#Name="Octa"}
Heh. Sounds like a handful.{#Name="Dito"}
Oh yes. Though her mind is sharp.{LF}Almost as sharp as her blades! Ho ho ho!{#Name="Octa"}
Hey, you seen what's-his-face lately?{#Name="Zero"}
I assume you mean Mikhail?{LF}No, I have not.{#Name="Decadus"}
Would you like me to turn back{LF}and look for him, my lady?{#Name="Decadus"}
No. Do it once and he'll expect it.{LF}Dummy's probably just lost again.{#Name="Zero"}
ミハイル知らない？お子ちゃまドラゴンなんだけど{#Name="ディト"}
さあ？さすがのオクタも、ドラゴンとヤッたことはありませぬ{#Name="オクタ"}
ヤッたかどうかは聞いてないよ{#Name="ディト"}
ヤッたことのないモノのことは、３歩歩くと忘れます。ほっほっほ{#Name="オクタ"}
Octa, is it true Lady Three's scissors{LF}can cut through anything?{#Name="Decadus"}
It is! You don't know how many times she{LF}tried to remove my precious trouser trout.{#Name="Octa"}
Uuungh... Just the thought of it...{LF}It sounds like a living hell...{#Name="Decadus"}
Indeed. Without Little Octa,{LF}I'd have nothing to live for!{#Name="Octa"}
Huh? What's this?{#Name="Zero"}
When I am open, I am not open.{#Name="Three"}
When I am closed, I am not closed.{LF}...What am I?{#Name="Three"}
The hell was that about?{#Name="Zero"}
Riddles, most likely.{LF}I imagine they're meaningless.{#Name="Octa"}
Lady Three always did enjoy her games of wit.{#Name="Octa"}
What a pain. That girl is messed in the head.{#Name="Zero"}
An apt description if I do say so myself!{LF}Ho ho ho!{#Name="Octa"}
So we just bash this box up while it's open?{#Name="Zero"}
Why the hell do I get experience for that?{#Name="Zero"}
Such boxes appear to be the key to opening{LF}doors in this area.{#Name="Octa"}
Not again...{#Name="Zero"}
I am approximately three by morning.{#Name="Three"}
I am most likely three by noon.{#Name="Three"}
I am occasionally three by night.{LF}...What am I?{#Name="Three"}
You're too goddamn vague is what you are!{#Name="Zero"}
I am a flower blooming by the pond.{#Name="Three"}
I am a butterfly floating in the night.{#Name="Three"}
I am the sea, crashing against the mountains.{LF}...What am I?{#Name="Three"}
How the hell should I know!?{LF}You're not making any sense!{#Name="Zero"}
My people shed their clothes whenever lost{LF}in the forest. ...What am I?{#Name="Three"}
You're nobody! Nobody does that!{#Name="Zero"}
1, 4, 7, 9, 12, 16, 19...{#Name="Three"}
Oh, what the sweet crispy fuck is this?{#Name="Zero"}
22, 10,789, 99,980. ...What comes next?{#Name="Three"}
My boot up your ass! How about that!?{#Name="Zero"}
This Three lady seems like a royal pain{LF}in the ass.{#Name="Dito"}
What makes you say so?{#Name="Decadus"}
Uh, hello? She has riddle machines?{#Name="Dito"}
This is the kind of thing that shut-ins do to try{LF}and make themselves seem all mysterious{LF}and alluring.{#Name="Dito"}
You...think so?{#Name="Decadus"}
Oh, God... You're still thinking about the{LF}scissors, aren't you?{#Name="Dito"}
No, I... Oooh... Maybe.{#Name="Decadus"}
Three may look delicate, but Octa says{LF}she's actually pretty brutal.{#Name="Dito"}
Ooooooh!{#Name="Decadus"}
I know, right? Crazy AND violent?{LF}Sounds like your soulmate.{#Name="Dito"}
Ahh...{#Name="Decadus"}
Look, how about I just crush your junk for you?{LF}...Ha ha ha! Relax, I'm just kidding!{#Name="Dito"}
...Dito. Where is the true you hiding?{#Name="Decadus"}
Huh? Wh-What are you talking about?{LF}I'm right here! Oh, you're such a joker! Ha ha!{#Name="Dito"}
Goodness! Someone's pants are getting{LF}a tad mountainous...{#Name="Octa"}
Don't look. It's shameful...{#Name="Decadus"}
On the contrary! Such excitement from thought{LF}alone is the sign of a pure heart.{#Name="Octa"}
Don't compliment me! I've been bad!{LF}So...very bad...{#Name="Decadus"}
Yeah...Three seems like a royal pain, all right.{#Name="Dito"}
Indeed she is. Although her body more{LF}than makes up for it! Ho ho ho!{#Name="Octa"}
Oh really? Well, she must be one tough{LF}cookie if she was able to handle you.{#Name="Dito"}
Oh, it's not like that. My incredible skill was{LF}enough to melt her, body AND soul!{#Name="Octa"}
But alas, her full potential was beyond{LF}even my own sordid imagination.{#Name="Octa"}
Just the sight of her love pantry was enough{LF}to make my snake spring from the can...{#Name="Octa"}
Ahh... It's so good to be young!{#Name="Octa"}
Young? ...You don't own a mirror, do you?{#Name="Dito"}
Oh ho ho! Believe it or not, I'm still only 22!{#Name="Octa"}
Huh? I'M 22. How can you be the same age as me!?{#Name="Dito"}
It's true! It seems my extensive erotic escapades{LF}have extinguished my youthful essence.{#Name="Octa"}
The hell, man... Sounds like you're just as freaky{LF}as the Intoner you served.{#Name="Dito"}
Are your actions crimes, Zero?{LF}Or do you consider this justice?{#Name="Three"}
Who cares? Good and evil are all the same.{#Name="Zero"}
Such a bloody sword... Is it light?{LF}Or is it heavy? Heh heh heh!{#Name="Three"}
Light enough to finish what I need to do.{#Name="Zero"}
Whether human or beast, all should{LF}brush their teeth between meals...{#Name="Three"}
Uhh...okay?{#Name="Zero"}
The eddy repeats. Sin meets sin,{LF}and despair meets despair.{#Name="Three"}
An eddy? Hey, Zero, what's an eddy?{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's a type of fruit.{#Name="Zero"}
None of us in this world are powerful.{#Name="Three"}
We merely hide our faults{LF}and guard our weaknesses.{#Name="Three"}
We were all lost forms of{LF}existence from the start...{#Name="Three"}
Dreamlike days are nothing but dreams.{#Name="Three"}
Unbelievable truths are nothing but lies.{#Name="Three"}
If we are doomed to separate,{LF}why do we seek each other?{#Name="Three"}
An eternal ouroboros will in the end{LF}devour us all.{#Name="Three"}
Hey, Zero! What's an ouro...whatever?{#Name="Mikhail"}
It's like when you swallow your tail{LF}and roll around like an idiot.{#Name="Zero"}
What? Hey, I don't do that!{LF}I'd never do that!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Those who know truth do not{LF}necessarily live by it...{#Name="Three"}
......{#Name="Three"}
Are you done? God, I thought she'd never shut up.{#Name="Zero"}
Excellently done, my lady.{#Name="Octa"}
What a drain. Who comes up with this shit?{#Name="Zero"}
But alas, I fear it will be even{LF}trickier from here on out.{#Name="Octa"}
Son of a bitch...{#Name="Zero"}
That huge tree in the distance is Lady Three's shrine.{#Name="Octa"}
To reach it, we must first navigate through the dreaded Lost Forest.{#Name="Octa"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
Oh! Zero! {#Name="Mikhail"}
{06}>{#Name="Mikhail"}
Let's go.{#Name="Zero"}
Okay!{#Name="Mikhail"}
