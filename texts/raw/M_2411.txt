Zero's here! She's invading!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Back me up! I'm going in!{#Name="Soldier B"}
I've got your back!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Where are the medics!?{#Name="Soldier D"}
Can we really kill an Intoner!?{#Name="Soldier E"}
Ohhh! Such a dreadful sight!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Aaaaaggghh! The accursed Intoner is here!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Ugh! How can they be so damn tough!?{#Name="Soldier B"}
Don't underestimate her!{#Name="Soldier E"}
来るかッ？　来るかッ？{#Name="兵士C"}
来たあああああッ！{#Name="兵士D"}
援護しますッ{#Name="兵士G"}
死にたいのか？　老いぼれにかまわず行けッ！{#Name="兵士F"}
She's...too damn strong!{#Name="Soldier A"}
We knew that when we took this job!{#Name="Soldier C"}
That's right! We knew we were fighting an Intoner!{#Name="Soldier D"}
We need to stop her here!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Let's do this!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Her sword... I can't even follow it!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Don't stand still! They'll kill you!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Shit!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Look out!{#Name="Soldier G"}
I can't go any further!{#Name="Soldier C"}
You! Fall back!{#Name="Soldier F"}
No, leave me! Focus on Zero!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Show 'em what we mortals are made of!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Show 'em what we mortals are made of!{#Name="Soldier B"}
There she is! Chaaaarge!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Aaaaaaaargh!{#Name="Soldier D"}
The only way to overcome your fear is to charge forward! Do it!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Get over here, demon, so I can kill you!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Watch what you wish for, fool! Remember, she's an Intoner!{#Name="Soldier F"}
A dark Intoner bent on destroying the world...{#Name="Soldier G"}
April the 14th, 1000 A.D.{#Name="Zero"}
We were pursuing Three in the Land of Forests,{#Name="Zero"}
but after obtaining a vital piece of info from Cent,{#Name="Zero"}
we decided to head back into the mountains...{#Name="Zero"}
Nnngh! It's freezing here!{#Name="Dito"}
You better not be wrong about this, Cent.{#Name="Zero"}
Me? Wrong? Ha! How absurd.{#Name="Cent"}
The most spectacularly delicious fruit{LF}in the world is juuuuuust ahead!{#Name="Cent"}
No fruit is worth trompin'{LF}through all this ice and shit.{#Name="Dito"}
If I'd known it would be this cold,{LF}I'd have stayed in the forest{LF}and tracked down Z's sisters.{#Name="Dito"}
Well, you can't fight on an empty{LF}stomach or...whatever.{#Name="Zero"}
Yaaay! Whatever! Whatever is my favorite!{#Name="Mikhail"}
But this better be the best{LF}damn fruit I ever tasted.{#Name="Zero"}
Don't you worry. It is delicious beyond compare!{#Name="Cent"}
The fruit is called a mendesian. Delightful, no?{#Name="Cent"}
Eaten alone, it has a clean,{LF}crisp taste redolent of spring.{#Name="Cent"}
But you can also make it into a rich{LF}jam to spread on bread or meat!{#Name="Cent"}
And nutritious? Oh my heavens, yes!{#Name="Cent"}
Far more so than your typical fruit, I might add.{#Name="Cent"}
Tell me, is it any good for the old trouser snake?{#Name="Octa"}
Good? It's nothing short of spectacular!{#Name="Cent"}
Oh ho ho! Well, there's a piece of fine news.{#Name="Octa"}
I can already feel my mem—er,{LF}emotions stirring at the thought!{#Name="Octa"}
Cerberus, huh?{#Name="Dito"}
Hey, you think he tastes any good?{#Name="Dito"}
Who can say? I doubt many ever{LF}had the chance to sample one.{#Name="Octa"}
I ate one once. Not bad. Lots of gristle.{#Name="Zero"}
The gristle was the best part!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Nnngh... Lady Zero, your diet{LF}is a bewildering thing.{#Name="Decadus"}
Goddammit, it's cold! Where's your{LF}stupid mendesian already?{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, we're close! Ever so close. {#Name="Cent"}
I'm going to turn it into jam and eat it{LF}by the spoonful!{#Name="Decadus"}
I'm gonna rub it all over my...uh...self!{#Name="Octa"}
541{#Name="541"}
I can't believe we're actually trusting{LF}this idiot...{#Name="Dito"}
Ah!{#Name="Cent"}
That treasure chest there!{#Name="Cent"}
...Oh dear.{#Name="Cent"}
...What the hell?{#Name="Zero"}
Ah... Ah ha ha! Yeaaah, I'm thinking I may{LF}have been a little off on this...{#Name="Cent"}
Oh, I just remembered! It's actually{LF}in the chest up ahead!{#Name="Cent"}
I got a bad feeling about this.{#Name="Dito"}
Right here! This is it for sure!{#Name="Cent"}
The treasure chest was empty.{#Name=" "}
{06}>{#Name="Dito"}
{06}>{#Name="Octa"}
{06}>{#Name="Decadus"}
Okay. Executive decision.{#Name="Zero"}
Next time we see a cerberus,{LF}we're gonna feed it Cent.{#Name="Zero"}
仕方ないじゃないですかぁあ。{LF}食べたら美味しいのは、事実なんですよぉお。{#Name="セント"}
私達は食べそびれたわけだから、{LF}その事実はどうでもいいんじゃないか？{#Name="デカート"}
あ、そうだ！　{LF}キングはぁあ、パスタにまぜても……{#Name="セント"}
だから！　現物がないのに{LF}料理方法を教えてくださらんで結構！{#Name="オクタ"}
487{#Name="487"}
Okay. Executive decision.{#Name="Zero"}
Next time we see a cerberus,{LF}we're gonna feed it Cent.{#Name="Zero"}
I got a bad feeling about this.{#Name="Dito"}
I know I've said it before, but if you don't change{LF}course soon, things are not going to end well.{#Name="Accord"}
That what your little book says?{#Name="Zero"}
Indeed.{#Name="Accord"}
...So you're not gonna show it to me?{#Name="Zero"}
I've been instructed not to interfere with the world.{#Name="Accord"}
Liar.{#Name="Zero"}
No, it's true!{#Name="Accord"}
But...well, nobody said I couldn't give little bits of advice, at least?{#Name="Accord"}
What the hell are you, anyway?{#Name="Zero"}
We're Recorders.{#Name="Accord"}
Recorders?{#Name="Zero"}
Right. It's our job to record world events,{LF}from the ancient past to the distant future...{#Name="Accord"}
You know the "Old World" you people are always going on about?{#Name="Accord"}
Well, I was sent by folks from there.{#Name="Accord"}
Listen, I don't know jack about the Old World.{#Name="Zero"}
But if you're following me just to make recordings{LF}or whatever, you can knock it the fuck off.{#Name="Zero"}
Well, sure, that's all I'm supposed to be doing...{#Name="Accord"}
But after all these bad endings you keep encountering,{LF}I'm really tempted to help.{#Name="Accord"}
Now, let's try and wrap things up in a way that benefits all of us, hmm?{#Name="Accord"}
Like I need you to tell me. I can wrap things up myself.{#Name="Zero"}
Defeat the Gray Cerberus!{#Name="説明文"}
Defeat the enemies blocking your way!{#Name="説明文"}
Search for Cent's precious fruit.{#Name="説明文"}

Can't...take this anymore... Zzz...{#Name="Dito"}
Stew... So nice and warm... Zzz...{#Name="Dito"}
Zzz... Mmmngh... H-Huh? Oh, my!{#Name="Decadus"}

Zzz... Huh? You're...going to sleep...Lady Zero?{#Name="Cent"}
How...strange... Zzz...{#Name="Cent"}
I'd better get some rest, too...{#Name="Zero"}
Get some much-needed sleep?{#Name=" "}
I'll kill you! I swear I'll kill you!{#Name="Soldier C"}
All right, next up...we've got this recording from Branch B.{#Name="Accord"}
No, not that one—that's Branch C!{#Name="Accord"}
And THAT'S Branch A! Come on!{#Name="Accord"}
There we go. That's Branch B! Finally...{#Name="Accord"}
Okay then! Let's have a look at recording M2410_E0005_FL...{#Name="Accord"}
Mmm...yeah. It's not this one either...{#Name="Cent"}
Um... Maybe the next mountain over?{#Name="Cent"}
Orrrr maybe the next nation over?{#Name="Cent"}
...Cent?{#Name="Zero"}
Yeees?{#Name="Cent"}
You're just making this shit up, aren't you?{#Name="Zero"}
Me? No, no! Never! No! ...No. {#Name="Cent"}
It's definitely, probably, somewhere{LF}on this continent.{#Name="Cent"}
That's it! I'm gonna pull your{LF}heart out your asshole!{#Name="Dito"}
Oh, hey! Now I remember! It's right over there!{#Name="Cent"}
Battered and exhausted after following{LF}Cent like a bunch of idiots,{#Name="Zero"}
we were forced to take shelter{LF}on a snowy mountainside.{#Name="Zero"}
Worthless trash obtained.{#Name="説明文"}
...Even more worthless trash obtained.{#Name="説明文"}
