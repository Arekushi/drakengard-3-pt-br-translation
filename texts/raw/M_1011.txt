What the...!?{#Name="Soldier B"}
It's her! That crazed Intoner's come to kill us!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Gyaaaah!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Take it easy. She's an Intoner, too!{#Name="Soldier E"}
B-But she's nothing like Lady Five... She's terrifying!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Shit... That dragon's headed for the battleship!{#Name="Soldier C"}
Well, staring at it won't help!{#Name="Soldier B"}
Does that dragon seem...small to you?{#Name="Soldier D"}
Just a hatchling, I'd wager.{#Name="Soldier C"}
But don't hold back. It's still lethal!{#Name="Soldier C"}
ダミー{#Name="ダミー"}
The bloody Intoner is an accursed sight.{#Name="Soldier F"}
Quite a difference from Lady Five and her beautiful golden aura...{#Name="Soldier E"}
Damn. We need a new plan, and fast!{#Name="Soldier A"}
I told you, we don't stand a chance against an Intoner!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Is this divine punishment? Have we sinned in some way?{#Name="Soldier F"}
Don't be absurd! Our Lady Five is on the side of benevolence!{#Name="Soldier B"}
This wound...is nothing... So long as I keep...Lady Five safe...{#Name="Soldier B"}
Don't get yourself killed over it. Lady Five still has Dito, remember?{#Name="Soldier E"}
Pfft. That sadistic little twit?{#Name="Soldier B"}
It's Zero! All infantry to the front!{#Name="Soldier D"}
One woman against an army... She must be mad!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Belay that kind of talk!{#Name="Soldier D"}
We've got casualties!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Medic! We need a medic now!{#Name="Soldier B"}
I think...this might be the end...{#Name="Soldier A"}
To die for Lady Five is to die in glory!{#Name="Soldier F"}
Dammit! All men, stay in front! Stop her at all costs!{#Name="Soldier A"}
I will protect Lady Five with my life!{#Name="Soldier B"}
She's not letting up!{#Name="Soldier C"}
I'm so...hungry... I'd kill for a nice ham right now...{#Name="Soldier D"}
What the hell are you saying!? We have to run!{#Name="Soldier A"}
Look at her! We're like nothing but flies to that woman!{#Name="Soldier E"}
Will this be the last battle I ever see?{#Name="Soldier F"}
I can't take this anymore... Mother, save me, please! MOOOTHEEER!{#Name="Soldier G"}
Hey, so you're really okay?{LF}You're not hurt anymore?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Well, it took a year, but yeah. I'm good.{#Name="Zero"}
Don't you think you should rest some more?{#Name="Mikhail"}
And watch you roll around in shit all day?{LF}No thanks.{#Name="Zero"}
Your big fight last year was pretty hard, huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Yep.{#Name="Zero"}
Did Michael say he was scared or anything?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Are you kidding?{#Name="Zero"}
Hmm... I guess you didn't retain any of his{LF}memories, huh?{#Name="Zero"}
Nope. Still, I can't believe he wasn't scared!{#Name="Mikhail"}
That's great. Just great!{LF}I'm gonna try to be just like him!{#Name="Mikhail"}
So, Zero... What'd you call Michael?{#Name="Mikhail"}
...Uh, Michael?{#Name="Zero"}
So why don't you call me "Mikhail," huh?{#Name="Mikhail"}
You know? Instead of "dummy" or{LF}"Hey, you" or...whatever?{#Name="Mikhail"}
You need to be a full-fledged dragon{LF}before I use your name.{#Name="Zero"}
Awww...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey, so you Intoners are all sisters, right?{#Name="Mikhail"}
More or less.{#Name="Zero"}
Man, I'm jealous. I don't have any brothers{LF}or sisters.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hey, it beats having a whole bunch you need to kill.{#Name="Zero"}
Uh, yeah, I guess...{#Name="Mikhail"}
See that battleship?{#Name="Zero"}
Uh-huh!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Torch it.{#Name="Zero"}
Um...really?{#Name="Mikhail"}
What, you're surprised?{#Name="Zero"}
Huh? Why?{LF}Can't we just talk to 'em instead?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Are you kidding? That'd be way too much effort.{#Name="Zero"}
So you kill people because...you're lazy?{#Name="Mikhail"}
I didn't ask for your opinion. Let's go.{#Name="Zero"}
You take out the ship from the air.{#Name="Zero"}
Okay.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I'll deal with the trash on the ground.{#Name="Zero"}
面倒臭いけど{#Name="ゼロ"}
All right, I'm going after the ship.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Be careful, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Just worry about yourself, dummy.{#Name="Zero"}
And stay focused!{#Name="Zero"}
It's her! It's Zero!{#Name="Soldier A"}
She's a disgrace to the Intoner name!{#Name="Soldier B"}
199{#Name="199"}

469{#Name="469"}
So this is the power of an Intoner...{#Name="Soldier F"}
Anybody in my way's gonna lose a head!{#Name="Zero"}
{06}>{#Name="Soldier G"}
Quit pissing yourself and let me kill you!{#Name="Zero"}
Watch yourself, dummy!{#Name="Zero"}
We're on Five's turf now!{#Name="Zero"}
You got it!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Oh, and if you slow me down, you're dead.{#Name="Zero"}
Scary! You're way too scary, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
You know, I don't think you should kill your sisters.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Oh yeah?{#Name="Zero"}
Yeah! If there's a problem, you should just talk it out!{#Name="Mikhail"}
You don't say.{#Name="Zero"}
I mean, that's the whole reason people have voices,{LF}right?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Hmm.{#Name="Zero"}
So...you get what I'm sayin'?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Not at all.{#Name="Zero"}
Keep going. Don't stop until you kill 'em all.{#Name="Zero"}

No.{#Name="Zero"}
What if they say they're sorry?{LF}...Or bring you a cake?{#Name="Mikhail"}
...No.{#Name="Zero"}
Awww...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!{#Name="Zero"}
Don't do that, Zero!{LF}It makes my tummy feel all funny!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Oh reeeally?{#Name="Zero"}
DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIIIE!{#Name="Zero"}
Hey! That's mean, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
I still don't get why you're doing this, Zero.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Look. I want to be the only Intoner in the world.{#Name="Zero"}
And that means I have to kill the others.{#Name="Zero"}
Clear enough for you?{#Name="Zero"}
No, not really.{#Name="Mikhail"}
I don't get it, Zero. I just don't get it.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Lemme know if you need me, Zero!{#Name="Mikhail"}
I'll come right over, okay?{#Name="Mikhail"}
Goddamn right you will.{#Name="Zero"}
And when you do, you better not chicken out on me.{#Name="Zero"}
That means no running away like a crybaby.{#Name="Zero"}
And no rolling around in your own filth.{#Name="Zero"}
Oh, all right...{#Name="Mikhail"}
Zero, are you okay?{#Name="Mikhail"}
You can always call on me, you know.{LF}You can call on me anytime!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Quit repeating things! It's annoying!{#Name="Zero"}
All right. Five should be in the Shrine of Seas{LF}up there.{#Name="Zero"}
Probably the first time that tramp's ever seen{LF}a shrine.{#Name="Zero"}
Is Five anything like you, Zero?{#Name="Mikhail"}
No.{#Name="Zero"}
I'm gonna talk to her.{LF}Maybe then you won't have to fight.{#Name="Mikhail"}
Whatever.{#Name="Zero"}
'Cause if she's nothing like you, maybe she'll{LF}actually listen to me!{#Name="Mikhail"}
That can-do attitude's gonna get you killed.{#Name="Zero"}
What the hell? Is that a shop?{#Name="Zero"}
Weapons...{#Name="Zero"}
Heh. Mail order, huh? Well, whatever works.{#Name="Zero"}
The gate's open!{#Name="Mikhail"}
Let's head for the shrine.{#Name="Zero"}
